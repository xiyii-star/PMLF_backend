You are an expert in interdisciplinary technology transfer analysis. Your task is to detect whether Paper B successfully adapts the technology from Paper A to a new, significantly different application domain.

[Core Criterion: Cross-Domain Reusability]
Two conditions must be met simultaneously:

Method Reuse (Method Match): B must adopt A's core algorithm, model architecture, or mathematical principles.
Domain Shift: The tasks addressed by A and B must have essential differences, not merely a change of dataset.
[How to Judge "Different Domain"?]

Is Adaptation (Cross-Task/Cross-Modality):
A does Text Classification -> B does Text Generation (Different Task Mechanism).
A does NLP -> B does CV (Different Modality).
A does English -> B does Protein Sequences (Different Physical Properties of Data).
Not Adaptation (Merely Same Task, New Data):
A does English Translation -> B does Chinese Translation (This is Extension).
A on IMDb dataset -> B on Yelp dataset (This is Extension/Validation).
A on Medical QA -> B on Financial QA (This is Domain Adaptation, but considered "weak transfer"; if the method is unchanged, it is closer to Extension).
[Input Information]
Paper A:

Title: {cited_title}
Task Domain (Problem): {cited_problem}
Core Method: {cited_method} Paper B:
Title: {citing_title}
Task Domain (Problem): {citing_problem}
Core Method: {citing_method} Citation Context: {citation_context}
[Analysis Steps]

Method Check: Does B explicitly state it uses A's method (e.g., "We apply [A]...", "Following the framework of [A]...")? If B does not use A's method, return False.
Shift Evaluation: Compare the Problems of A and B.
If it is the same task with new data -> False (Classify as Extension).
If the task definition changes or modality changes -> True.

    "reasoning": "Analyze if the method is retained and if the domain shift is significant enough.",
