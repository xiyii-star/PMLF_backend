A survey of Canadian managers and professionals was conducted to develop and validate a measure of computer self-efficacy and to assess both its impacts and antecedents. Computer self-efficacy was found to exert a significant influence on individuals’ expectations of the outcomes of using computers, their emotional reactions to co...",

This measurement enables researchers and practitioners to systematically examine how these beliefs influence computer use, outcome expectations, and emotional reactions. The validation process ensures the measure's accuracy and applicability to real-world organizational contexts.",
