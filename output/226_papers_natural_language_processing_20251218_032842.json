There is very little work on studying the generalization of prompting and generation across languages, in the way that transfer learning has been applied to learning in one language and testing in another (Conneau et al., 2020) .",

The success of prompts in zero-and few-shot learning has been attributed to the prompts serving as instructions that allow the PLM to learn with fewer examples, much the way humans would (Mishra et al., 2021; Schick and Schütze, 2021a; Brown et al., 2020) . In fact, the excellent results may instead be attributable to the mere exploitation of patterns in the training data of PLMs, and not to PLMs' perceived ability to interpret and follow meaningful instructions. Webson and Pavlick (2021) show, for instance, that irrelevant templates match the performance of meaningful ones in few-shot entailment experiments, adding that some of the templates discovered by automatic generation of discrete prompts are also unnatural (Shin et al., 2020) . In this sense, the results of continuous prompts also show that PLMs do not need meaningful instructions for improving few-shot performance.",

This is not a trivial issue, witness the concerns in other traditionally data-intensive research communities regarding the misuses and misinterpretations of simple statistical tests. As machine learning models tend to be a lot more complex, and in many cases more opaque than the models used in traditional statistical testing, their potential misuse should be a cause for concern. For instance, while the interpretation of a co-occurrence matrix is straightforward, an embedding vector which might involve non-linear transformations of the original data would not be as easy to interpret. Therefore, somewhat in opposition to the need to provide usable interfaces just discussed, it seems that ensuring the proper use of computational linguistics methods based on machine learning will require a level of proficiency in these methods which cannot be achieved simply through better user interfaces. This is however an active area of research, and new techniques of visualisation and model explanation are being proposed which might alleviate this problem in future. A related issue concerns the incorporation of new technology into translator education. Doherty and Kenny (2014) argue for ways of incorporating statistical machine translation into the translation training curriculum in a way that promotes a good understanding of the underlying technology and therefore empowers the translator.",

          "text": "Clearly, good user interface support for users of computational linguistics tools is crucial in applications such as translator training and computer assisted translation. With the advent of corpus based translation studies, it has also become important to provide the research community with usable tools which will also allow researchers to document and share their work. Tools such as the Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al. 2014) , the BYU corpora (Davies and Fuchs 2015; Davies 2010) , the CQPweb corpus analysis system (Hardie 2012) , and the modnlp/tec (Luz 2011 ) software suite can be seen as efforts towards these goals. However, the use of analytic tools and corpora is still hampered by software access and licensing constraints. With the exception of modnlp/tec, all of the above mentioned tools are exclusively web based. While using the web as a platform certainly facilitates access, the absence of a stand-alone, offline tool limits the more experienced user's flexibility and their ability to explore their own resources, which they might not wish or have the legal right to share. Another issue of access concerns licensing terms which might limit access to software source code, or prevent it entirely. Unfortunately, most web based tools in this area are commercial products, provide very limited functionality, or charge fees for \"premium access\". Two exceptions among the tools cited are CQPweb and modnlp/tec, both of which are distributed under FLOSS licenses. The ability to inspect and modify source code has been increasingly regarded as a crucial aspect of reproducibility in data-intensive research (Hutson 2018) . If corpus based studies are to develop a robust methodology for the use of computational linguistics tools and methods, the issue of sharing source code as well as data needs to be addressed.

This is not a trivial issue, witness the concerns in other traditionally data-intensive research communities regarding the misuses and misinterpretations of simple statistical tests. As machine learning models tend to be a lot more complex, and in many cases more opaque than the models used in traditional statistical testing, their potential misuse should be a cause for concern. For instance, while the interpretation of a co-occurrence matrix is straightforward, an embedding vector which might involve non-linear transformations of the original data would not be as easy to interpret. Therefore, somewhat in opposition to the need to provide usable interfaces just discussed, it seems that ensuring the proper use of computational linguistics methods based on machine learning will require a level of proficiency in these methods which cannot be achieved simply through better user interfaces. This is however an active area of research, and new techniques of visualisation and model explanation are being proposed which might alleviate this problem in future. A related issue concerns the incorporation of new technology into translator education. Doherty and Kenny (2014) argue for ways of incorporating statistical machine translation into the translation training curriculum in a way that promotes a good understanding of the underlying technology and therefore empowers the translator.",

          "text": "Clearly, good user interface support for users of computational linguistics tools is crucial in applications such as translator training and computer assisted translation. With the advent of corpus based translation studies, it has also become important to provide the research community with usable tools which will also allow researchers to document and share their work. Tools such as the Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al. 2014) , the BYU corpora (Davies and Fuchs 2015; Davies 2010) , the CQPweb corpus analysis system (Hardie 2012) , and the modnlp/tec (Luz 2011 ) software suite can be seen as efforts towards these goals. However, the use of analytic tools and corpora is still hampered by software access and licensing constraints. With the exception of modnlp/tec, all of the above mentioned tools are exclusively web based. While using the web as a platform certainly facilitates access, the absence of a stand-alone, offline tool limits the more experienced user's flexibility and their ability to explore their own resources, which they might not wish or have the legal right to share. Another issue of access concerns licensing terms which might limit access to software source code, or prevent it entirely. Unfortunately, most web based tools in this area are commercial products, provide very limited functionality, or charge fees for \"premium access\". Two exceptions among the tools cited are CQPweb and modnlp/tec, both of which are distributed under FLOSS licenses. The ability to inspect and modify source code has been increasingly regarded as a crucial aspect of reproducibility in data-intensive research (Hutson 2018) . If corpus based studies are to develop a robust methodology for the use of computational linguistics tools and methods, the issue of sharing source code as well as data needs to be addressed. A related issue is the availability and stability of the software. Users of purely web based tools are entirely dependent on the software provider for their analytic work.

Thus, we think that our findings are well applicable to certifying fairness in a corporate environment. However, we did not cover other sectors, such as public or military. Furthermore, we might not have reached theoretical saturation with 14 interviewees. Moreover, designing and testing a fairness certification process itself was beyond our scope. One might wonder if this work on fairness and bias was influenced by bias itself. We explicitly tried to exclude the following biases: Selection bias (selecting interview partners on personal preferences), bias in materials (providing docu-ments before the interviews could have influenced the interviewees), verbal/nonverbal bias (due to misunderstandings between interviewer and interviewee) and bias in data analysis (subjective coding).",

One of the biggest challenges in decoding strategy modifications is balancing bias mitigation with diverse output generation. These methods typically rely on identifying toxic or harmful tokens, which requires a classification method that is not only accurate but also unbiased in its own right (see Section 3.5.4 for discussion of challenges with classifier-based techniques). Unfortunately, minority voices are often disproportionately filtered out as a result. For instance, Xu et al. (2021) find that techniques that reduce toxicity can in turn amplify bias by not generating minority dialects like African-American English. Any decoding algorithm that leverages some heuristic to identify bias must take special care to not further marginalize underrepresented and minoritized voices. Kumar et al. (2023b) also warn that decoding algorithms may be",

          "text": "Akyürek et al. ( 2022 ) discuss how modeling choices can significantly shift conclusions from generated text bias metrics. For instance, decoding parameters, including the number of tokens generated, the temperature for sampling, and the top-k choice for beam search, can drastically change the level of bias, which can lead to contradicting results for the same metric with the same evaluation datasets, but different parameter choices. Furthermore, the impact of decoding parameter choices on generated text-based metrics may be inconsistent across evaluation datasets. At the very least, metrics should be reported with the prompting set and decoding parameters for transparency and clarity. We also discuss the limitations of each class of generated text-based metrics. As Cabello, Jørgensen, and Søgaard (2023) point out, word associations with protected attributes may be a poor proxy for downstream disparities, which may limit distributionbased metrics that rely on vectors of co-occurrence counts. For example, co-occurrence does not account for use-mention distinctions, where harmful words may be mentioned in the same context of a social group (e.g., as counterspeech) without using them to target that group (Gligoric et al. 2024) . Classifier-based metrics may be unreliable if the classifier itself has its own biases. For example, toxicity classifiers may disproportionately flag African-American English (Mozafari, Farahbakhsh, and Crespi 2020; Sap et al. 2019) , and sentiment classifiers may incorrectly classify statements about stigmatized groups (e.g., people with disabilities, mental illness, or low socioeconomic status) as negative (Mei, Fereidooni, and Caliskan 2023) . Similarly, Pozzobon et al. (2023) highlight that automatic toxicity detection are not static and are constantly evolving. Thus, research relying solely on these scores for comparing models may result in inaccurate and misleading findings. These challenges may render classifier-based metrics themselves biased and unreliable. Finally, lexicon-based metrics may be overly coarse and overlook relational patterns between words, sentences, or phrases. Biased outputs can also be constructed from sequences of words that appear harmless individually, which lexicon-based metrics do not fully capture.",

Such approaches can gear downstream training towards macro-averaged optimization that encourages improvement for minority classes. Data generation can set a strong standard for careful data curation that can be followed for future datasets. For example, drawing inspiration from works like Davani, Díaz, and Prabhakaran (2022), Denton et al. (2021) , and Fleisig, Abebe, and Klein (2023), future datasets can ensure that the identities, backgrounds, and perspectives of human authors are documented so that the positionality of datasets are not rendered invisible or neutral (Leavy, Siapera, and O'Sullivan 2021) .",

Masked token metrics rely on templates, which often lack semantic and syntactic diversity and have highly limited sets of target words to instantiate the template, which can cause the metrics to lack generalizability and reliability. Blodgett et al. (2021) highlight shortcomings of pseudolog-likelihood metrics that compare stereotype and anti-stereotype sentences. The notion that stereotype and anti-stereotype sentences, which, by construction, do not reflect real-world power dynamics, should be selected at equal rates (using Equation 16 ) is not obvious as an indicator of fairness, and may depend heavily on the conceptualization of what stereotypes and anti-stereotypes entail in the evaluation dataset (see further discussion in Section 4.1.3). Furthermore, merely selecting between two sentences may not fully capture the tendency of a model to produce stereotypical outputs, and can misrepresent the model's behavior by ranking sentences instead of more carefully examining the magnitude of likelihoods directly.",

Our first taxonomy for metrics characterized the relationship between evaluation metrics and datasets, and organized metrics by the type of data on which they operate. Our second taxonomy for datasets described common data structures for bias evaluation; we also consolidated and released publicly-available datasets to increase accessibility. Our third taxonomy for mitigation techniques classified methods by their intervention stage, with a detailed categorization of trends within each stage. Finally, we outlined several actionable open problems and challenges to guide future research. We hope that this work improves understanding of technical efforts to measure and reduce the perpetuation of bias by LLMs and facilitates further exploration in these domains.",

For instance, Han, Baldwin, and Cohn (2023) propose analysis of the Pareto frontiers for different hyperparameter values to understand the relationship between fairness and performance. We also refer back to our discussion of disaggregated analysis in Section 6.1 to carefully track what drives performance declines and whether performance changes are experienced by all social groups uniformly. In this vein, we emphasize that achieving more fair outcomes should not be framed as an impediment to the standard, typically aggregated performance metrics like accuracy, but rather as a necessary criterion for building systems that do not further perpetuate harm.",

These models demonstrate significant potential not only in medicine-assisted diagnosis, biopharmaceutical design, and medical image segmentation, but also in achievements related to health management, doctor-patient communication, and multimodal applications of LLMs in medicine. However, challenges persist, encompassing issues such as data privacy, model interpretability, ethical concerns, and technical difficulties in practical implementations. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to ensure the reliability and safety of models in real clinical environments. Regarding these problems, we proposed several technologies that are possible to combine with medical LLMs to solve them, including Metaverse, blockchain, smart medical devices, and future research directions for researchers. In summary, LLMs bring unprecedented opportunities to the field of medicine. LLMs in medicine are poised to play a greater role in personalized medicine, new drug development, and health management. Nevertheless, it is imperative to prioritize ethical and privacy considerations in this process. We anticipate achieving more significant accomplishments in improving patient quality of life, advancing medical research, and optimizing medical processes. Encouraging collaborative efforts among future researchers and practitioners is essential to drive the development of LLMs in medicine for the benefit of humanity.",

Among the use cases introduced in this chapter, some applications of NLP are relatively safe as they mainly involve analysing public political documents and fact-based evidence or effects of policies. However, others could be concerning and vulnerable to misuse. For example, although effective, truthful policy communication is beneficial for society, it might be tempting to overdo policy communication and by all means optimize the votes. As it is highly important for government and politicians to gain positive public perception, overly optimizing policy communication might lead to propaganda, intrusion of data privacy to collect more user preferences, and, in more severe cases, surveillance and violation of human rights. Hence, there is a strong need for policies to regulate the use of technologies that influence public opinions and pose a challenge to democracy.",

          "text": "There are several limitations that researchers and policymakers need to take into consideration when using NLP for policymaking, due to the data-driven and black-box nature of modern NLP. First, the effectiveness of the computational models relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data. Although many political discourses are public, including data sources such as news, press releases, legislation, and campaigns, when it comes to surveying public opinions, social media might be a biased representation of the whole population. Therefore, when making important policy decisions, the traditional polls and surveys can provide more comprehensive coverage. Note that in the case of traditional polls, NLP can still be helpful in expediting the processing of survey answers.",

          "section": "Limitations and Ethical Considerations",
          "text": "The second concern is the black-box nature of modern NLP models. We do not encourage decision-making systems to depend fully on NLP, but suggest that NLP can assist human decision-makers. Hence, all the applications introduced in this chapter use NLP to compile information that is necessary for policymaking instead of directly suggesting a policy. Nonetheless, some of the models are hard to interpret or explain, such as text classification using deep learning models (Brown et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2019) , which could be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by small paraphrasing of the text input (Jin et al., 2020) . In practical applications, it is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the usage of AI. There could be a preference for transparent machine learning models if they can do the work well (e.g. LDA topic models and traditional classification methods using dictionaries or linguistic rules) or tasks with well-controlled outputs such as event extraction to select spans of the given text that mention events. In cases where only the deep learning models can provide good performance, there should be more detailed performance analysis (e.g. a study to check the correlation of the model decisions and human judgments), error analysis (e.g. different types of errors, failure modes, and potential bias towards certain groups), and studies about the interpretability of the model (e.g. feature attribution of the model, visualization of the internal states of the model).",

We mask a single word in each document at random, and measure the accuracy at predicting it. 7 To that end, we use the same procedure used for training (illustrated in Figure 1 ), which moves the mask token to the end of the sequence. 8 This approach is not suitable for models trained exclusively on next token prediction like NXTUNI and NXTPRE, as they can only be conditioned on the right context. However, one can still use such models for infilling in a generative fashion, replacing the masked token with each element in the vocabulary, scoring the resulting sequences autoregressively, and predicting the token yield- ing the highest scoring sequence. In addition to our primary evaluation, we compare both of these approaches, which we refer to as infill (direct infilling) and full (full sequence scoring). Given that full can be prohibitively expensive when considering the full vocabulary, we constrain the set of options to the top 32 candidates generated by the 125M MSKBI model. 9",

This is consistent with how close the pre-training objective is to the end task: NXTUNI is exclusively trained on next token prediction, HYBUNI combines it with masking (which is not used here), and HYBPRE further combines it with a bidirectional attention prefix (which is not used here either). However, it is interesting that scaling up does not reduce the gap between them. This suggests that there is some fundamental interference between these different capabilities, 12 and increasing capacity does not mit- 12 There are various factors that could explain this. Both masking and the bidirectional attention prefix reduce the supervision on next token prediction, and masking further introduces some noise in the original sequence. Moreover, training to use both unidirectional and bidirectional attention and/or context might provide a conflicting signal, although our results later in §4.2 suggest that this does not have a major impact at igate it. Table 4 reports suffix perplexity results, where we predict the last 20% of the tokens in each document conditioned on the rest. Compared to the previous results, NXTPRE and HYBPRE reduce the gap with NXTUNI and HYBUNI, but they still lag behind them. In both cases, we find that the models benefit from using bidirectional attention in the prefix at inference time (i.e., higher values of r bidir yield lower perplexity), but the improvement is relatively small. It is intriguing that NXTUNI outperforms NXTPRE, when the latter was trained on suffix prediction and can leverage bidirectional attention. We attribute this to the bidirectional prefix reducing the number of tokens of supervision during training.",

By unifying the model output space across tasks to consist of natural language symbols, these approaches reduce the gap between language model pre-training tasks and downstream tasks. Moreover, this framework allows acquisition of new tasks without any architectural change.

Label semantics provide contextual signals that can improve model performance in multi-task and low-resource scenarios. Multiple works show that conditioning input representations on slot description embeddings improves multidomain slot labeling performance (Bapna et al., 2017; Lee and Jha, 2019) . Embedding example slot values in addition to slot descriptions yields further improvements in zero-shot slot labeling (Shah et al., 2019) .

          "text": "To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we quantify the trade-off between adapter capacity and adaptation performance on both IWSLT and JRC-Acquis. In Figures 2 and 3 , we plot the adaptation performance on IWSLT and JRC-Acquis respectively, while varying adapter capacity. On IWSLT, we notice that residual adapters reach within 0.5 BLEU of the full fine-tuning upper bound with just 0.03% of the model capacity, corresponding to a hidden dimension of size 4. By increasing capacity further we were able to improve over the full fine-tuning baseline by around 0.5 BLEU. On the other hand, on JRC-Acquis, adapter capacity had to be increased up to 13.5% of the total model capacity, corresponding to a hidden dimension of size 2048, before we were within 0.5 BLEU of the full fine-tuning performance. This highlights a key strength of the approach: by varying adapter capacity it is possi-ble to adapt the same model to domains of varying complexity and amounts of data. To evaluate the effectiveness of adapters when adapting with small in-domain corpora, we further compare the performance of adapters with fine-tuning on varying amounts of training data. In Figure 6 we plot the adaptation performance on IWSLT, when using different fractions of the training corpus for adaptation. While LHUC is competitive with full fine-tuning and light-weight adapters for extremely small fractions, the lack of capacity limits the applicability of the approach when larger quantities of adaptation data are available. On the other hand, by tuning the capacity of adapters to match the requirements for the adaptation corpus size, we are able to match and outperform fine-tuning on almost all evaluated datapoints.",

We attribute this deterioration to two factors: (i) Languages compete for capacity given the limited model size, and (ii) The model converges much before it trains on significant portions of the high resource datasets.",

The systems were tested against the same set of articles (five articles in total). One of these articles was common to all members and used for training so they could familiarize themselves with their assigned system. For this, an article previously curated by all group members was selected (PMC2613882, the subject of Table 2 ). Each of the systems was primarily assessed by two members, with each member curating a different set of two articles which were novel to them. The exception to the assessment procedure above was MyMiner which was inspected separately as it was not originally designed to meet the specifications of the IAT task. The assessment of all systems was done remotely. The UAG members curated the articles using the system: they would get the raw output from the system, go over the gene list provided by the system and add any missing genes, correct misassigned organisms, and identify central genes. Once the initial assisted-curation task was complete, curators were permitted to use and comment on other systems. Note that there were some limitations to testing, including assignment of two curators per system and the number of articles processed, due to time constraints (only 2 weeks), and number of UAG members that participated in the testing (not all were available). UAG members recorded the time spent curating using the assigned system. The latter activity could not be reliably compared in all cases because some of the UAG members timed their annotation for validating central genes, while others timed their activity for validating all genes. However, in one case we can provide some preliminary information based on comparison to the manual, unassisted time spent for curation (see case 1 in Result section).",

          "text": "For example, in the case of PMC2684697 [14] , gata1, e2f2, fog-1 and pRB were assigned as central genes based on their contribution to the novel assertions put forth by the authors. In contrast, genes such as CD71, c-kit, ter119, GFP, and beta-actin were mentioned multiple times in the Results section, but these were used in the experiments either as cell type markers or controls. However, the genes that were unanimously identified as central by the UAG (genes selected as central by all members, in Table 2 ) coincided with the view in i). In the end, the UAG agreed to define gene centrality in terms of genes whose experimental manipulation contributed to the main assertions of the article, and further agreed that an ideal system should rank higher those genes undergoing real characterization than those serving as controls or used as molecular reagents. It is important to note that in the context of this task, centrality was a binary criterion: if there were mentions of genes that were involved in some experiment (not as controls) then they were considered central. However, the amount of information content for the different genes described in the article would be different and the frequency of mention could be used to rank the genes in the context of overall importance within the article (e.g., this article is mainly about genes A and C).",

While this highlights the potential for improvement, we're also encouraged that achieving convincing results does not require a thorough temperature search or prompt engineering.",

We consider the benefit of larger models in Figure A3 , finding this improvement marginal for Llama-2 (13B) compared to Llama-2 (7B). While there may exist opensource models which perform slightly better than our selections, we do not believe this would meaningfully alter our analysis-especially considering the clinical reader study employs GPT-4, which is an established state-of-the-art [21] .",

For instance, our progress notes task employs ICU notes from a single medical center. These notes may be structured differently from non-ICU notes or from ICU notes of a different center. Additionally, more challenging tasks may require summarizing longer documents or multiple documents of different types. Addressing these cases demands two key advancements: (1) extending model context length, potentially through multi-query aggregation or other methods [97, 98] (2) introducing open-source datasets that include broader tasks and lengthier documents. We thus advocate for expanding evaluation to other summarization tasks.",

It is the largest study to date examining the diagnostic accuracy of DL on medical imaging. However, our findings must be viewed in consideration of several limitations. Firstly, as we believe that many studies have methodological deficiencies or are poorly reported, these studies may not be a reliable source for evaluating diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, the estimates of diagnostic performance provided in our meta-analysis are uncertain and may represent an overestimation of the true accuracy. Secondly, we did not conduct a quality assessment for the transparency of reporting in this review. This was because current guidelines to assess diagnostic accuracy reporting standards (STARD-2015 114 ) were not designed for DL studies and are not fully applicable to the specifics and nuances of DL research 115 . Thirdly, due to the nature of DL studies, we were not able to perform classical statistical comparison of measures of diagnostic accuracy between different imaging modalities. Fourthly, we were unable to separate each imaging modality into different subsets, to enable comparison across subsets and allow the heterogeneity and variance to be broken down. This was because our study aimed to provide an overview of the literature in each specific speciality, and it was beyond the scope of this review to examine each modality individually. The inherent differences in imaging technology, patient populations, pathologies and study designs meant that attempting to derive common lessons across the board did not always offer easy comparisons.",

The variation in reporting makes it very difficult to formally evaluate performance of algorithms. Furthermore, differences in reference standards, grader capabilities, disease definitions and thresholds for diagnosis make direct comparison between studies and algorithms very difficult. This can only be improved with welldesigned and executed studies that explicitly address questions concerning transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness 116 and specific reporting standards for AI studies 115, 117 . The QUADAS-2 (ref. 118 ) assessment tool was used to systematically evaluate the risk of bias and any applicability concerns of the diagnostic accuracy studies. Although this tool was not designed for DL diagnostic accuracy studies, the evaluation allowed us to judge that a majority of studies in this field are at risk of bias or concerning for applicability.

However, despite recent improvements in factual accuracy 21 , the recurring issue of misinformation (Box 2, Supplementary Data, example 10 63 ) and potentially harmful consequences for patient care remains. Technical options to overcome limitations in factuality and mitigate (bias-related) harms can generally be implemented throughout the entire development process of LLMs. Input data can be improved through sampling and filtering processes, model architectures can be augmented to incorporate factual information from databases or knowledge graphs, harmful outputs can be detected and rewritten on inference level, and harmful and false model outputs can be flagged and redacted 33, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] .

First, data privacy is of utmost importance to protect sensitive personal data that is routinely assessed, documented and exchanged in clinical settings. Reports of data leakage 71 or malicious attempts (prompt injection attacks to steal data) 72 are concerning and have to be addressed. Implementing APIs 23, 26 into independent, secure applications rather than using interfaces such as ChatGPT could solve this issue. A second challenge arises from the lack of publicly available training datasets and source code 63 . As the output quality of any model is highly dependent on the quality of the input data, it is crucial for the scientific community to gain insights into the underlying data of current LLMs. Lastly, to date, the development of LLMs has been driven primarily by commercial companies such as OpenAI/Microsoft 21 , Meta 24 , and Google 2 . To prevent medical knowledge and healthcare access from being restricted to global monopolies, it is essential to encourage the development of non-commercial open-source LLM projects 9, 63 .",

This verifies that RETFound generates reliable predicted probabilities, rather than overconfident ones. The experiments show that both modalities of CFP and OCT have unique ocular and systemic information encoded that is valuable in predicting future health states. For ocular diseases, some image modalities are commonly used for a diagnosis in which the specific lesions can be well observed, such as OCT for wet-AMD. However, such knowledge is relatively vague in oculomic tasks as (1) the markers for oculomic research on different modalities are under exploration and (2) it requires a fair comparison between many modalities with identical evaluation settings. In this work, we investigate and compare the efficacy of CFP and OCT for oculomic tasks with identical training and evaluation details (for example, train, validation and/or test data splitting is aligned by anonymous patient IDs). We notice that the models with CFP and OCT achieve unequal performances in predicting systemic diseases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3 ), suggesting that CFP and OCT contain different levels of information for oculomic tasks. For instance, in 3-year incidence prediction of ischaemic stroke, RETFound with CFP performs better than with OCT on both MEH-AlzEye (internal evaluation) and UK Biobank (external evaluation). For the task of Parkinson's disease, RETFound with OCT shows significantly better performance in internal evaluation. These observations may indicate that various disorders of ageing (for example, stroke and Parkinson's disease) manifest different early markers on retinal images. A practical implication for health service providers and imaging device manufacturers is to recognize that CFP has continuing value, and should be retained as part of the standard retinal assessment in eye health settings.

It seems that the generative approach using the masked autoencoder generally outperforms the contrastive approaches, including SwAV, SimCLR, MoCo-v3 and DINO. However, it is worth noting that asserting the superiority of the masked autoencoder requires caution, given the presence of several variables across all models, such as network architectures (for example, ResNet-50 for SwAV and SimCLR, Transformers for the others) and hyperparameters (for example, learning rate scheduler). Our comparison demonstrates that the combination of powerful network architecture and complex pretext tasks can produce effective and general-purpose medical foundation models, aligning with the insights derived from large language models in healthcare 49, 50 . Furthermore, the comparison further supports the notion that the retinal-specific context learned from the masked autoencoder's pretext task, which includes anatomical structures such as the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer (as shown in Extended Data Fig. 6a ), indeed provides discriminative information for the detection of ocular and systemic diseases.",

Ocular diseases are diagnosed by the presence of well-defined pathological patterns, such as hard exudates and haemorrhages for diabetic retinopathy. These features involve abnormal variations in colour or structure, showing visible differences from the surrounding retina. RETFound can identify disease-related patterns and correctly diagnose ocular diseases (for example, myopia and diabetic retinopathy cases in Extended Data Fig. 6b ). In Fig. 2 , we observe that RETFound ranks first in various tasks, followed by SL-ImageNet. SL-ImageNet pretrains the model using supervised learning on ImageNet-21k, which contains 14 million images with 21,000 categories of natural objects with diverse shapes and textures, such as zebras and oranges. Such diverse characteristics allow models to learn abundant low-level features (for example, lines, curves and edges) to identify the boundary of abnormal patterns, thus improving disease diagnosis when the model adapts to medical tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using SSL successively on natural images and unlabelled retinal images, a generalizable foundation model (RETFound) can be developed to further improve ocular disease diagnosis and prognosis, even outperforming the powerful SL-ImageNet.",

It is obvious that a model being able to generate natural language to explain its predictions is beneficial to the end user of a system, in order to better understand why a model made a certain prediction. However, these results go far beyond that, demonstrating that prompting the model to generate explicit inference chains can drastically increase the quality of the predictions themselves. In other words, the model's generation (rather than just understanding) capabilities can be immensely beneficial even for tasks that are modeled as categorical prediction or regression, which typically do not require significant language generation.",

As such, our fairness evaluations in this section are also limited by the same concerns and there are potential risks beyond what can be measured. We expand upon previous efforts to evaluate unintended biases and our evaluations are limited to popular tasks such as pronoun resolution (Winogender) (Rudinger et al., 2018) and co-occurrence analysis.

Additionally, as Sambasivan et al.

It is unclear how the \"value\" of repeated data compares to unseen data for large-scale language model training.

Throughout the rest of the paper, we primarily focus on exploring factor (1), although it is clear from this work and prior work that this is not the only important factor. For instance, PaLM 62B outperforms GPT-3 and other large LMs on a significant number of tasks, despite having a much lower total training FLOP count. This would hint at (3) being a major factor, although we do not perform the necessary ablation studies to say this conclusively. However, Du et al. (2021) did perform ablation studies on the same training corpus, and show that the improvement in few-shot learning from careful data filtering is extremely significant.",

What about a 120B model for 3.6T tokens? 240B for 1.8T tokens?\" It is clear that such a model would have roughly the same total training cost as PaLM 540B. However, if downstream task performance were to be comparable, the smaller model would certainly be preferable, as the inference cost is proportional to its size.",

Moreover, the effect of model scale on CoT can also be observed in Table 5 . For BBH, models that are not instruction finetuned only benefit from CoT if they are 62B or larger. This is consistent with prior observations that CoT is an emergent ability of scaling language models (Wei et al., 2022a) .

Instead, we assume that models have acquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This process is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the downstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up from reading the same text. This motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how humans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large question bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk about the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available, such as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum, but there are fewer than 5,000 multistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number of practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.",

Importantly, the format of our evaluation is not identical to the format in which information is acquired during pretraining.

The pre-released version of BioBERT (January 2019) has already been shown to be very effective in many biomedical text mining tasks such as NER for clinical notes (Alsentzer et al., 2019) , human phenotype-gene RE (Sousa et al., 2019) and clinical temporal RE (Lin et al., 2019) . The following updated versions of BioBERT will be available to the bioNLP community: (i) BioBERT BASE and BioBERT LARGE trained on only PubMed abstracts without initialization from the existing BERT model and (ii) BioBERT BASE and BioBERT LARGE trained on domain-specific vocabulary based on WordPiece.",

In Masked LM, the goal is to predict a masked code using the sequential information from the forward and the backward directions. In Prolonged LOS, the goal is to determine whether a patient is associated with any visit that is a prolonged stay, which also relies on cumulative contexts. We believe that, by including the prediction tasks from both the code level and the patient (sequence) level, Med-BERT can further strengthen the representation learning of EHR sequences from different granularities.",

          "text": "The efficiency of pre-trained ELMo and BERT models are investigated by reporting the loss during pre-training steps and by evaluating the intermediate checkpoints on downstream tasks. It is observed for both ELMo and BERT at their pre-training stages, the train perplexity or loss decreases as the steps increase, indicating that the language model is actually adapting to the clinical corpus. If there is no intervention to stop the pretraining process, it will lead to a very small loss value. However, this will ultimately cause overfitting on the pre-training corpus (shown in Supplemental Figure 1 ). However, this will bring to another common issue that the model might be overfitting on the training set. Using i2b2 2010 as the downstream task, the final performance at each intermediate checkpoint of the pre-trained model is shown in Figure 2 . For ELMo, as the pre-training proceeds, the performance of the downstream task remains stable after a certain number of iterations (the maximum F1 reaches 87.80 at step 280K). For BERT BASE , the performance on the downstream task is less steady and tends to decrease after achieving its optimal model, with the maximum F1 89.55 at step 340K. We theorize that this is due to initializing the MIMIC model with the open-domain BERT model: over many iterations on the MIMIC data, the information learned from the large open corpus (3.3 billion words) is lost and would eventually converge on a model similar to one initialized from scratch. Thus, limiting pre-training on a clinical corpus to a certain number of iterations provides a useful trade-off, balancing the benefits of a large open-domain corpus while still learning much from a clinical corpus. We hope this is a practical piece of guidance for the clinical NLP community when they intend to generate their own pre-trained model from a clinical corpus.",

Unlike the previously mentioned traditional word embeddings that constitute a single vector for each word and the vector remains stable in downstream tasks, this contextual word representation can capture the context information and dynamically alter a multilayer representation. At training time, a language model objective is used to learn the context-sensitive embeddings from a large text corpus. The training step of learning these context-sensitive embeddings is known as pre-training. After pre-training, the contextsensitive embedding of each word will be fed into the sentences for downstream tasks. The downstream task learns the shared weights of the inner state of pre-trained language model by optimizing the loss on the downstream task.",

          "text": "Word-level vector representation methods learn a real-valued vector to represent a single word. One of the most prominent methods for word-level representation is word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) . So far, word2vec has widely established its effectiveness for achieving state-of-the-art performances in a variety of clinical NLP tasks (Wang et al., 2018a) . GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) is another unsupervised learning approach to obtain a vector representation for a single word. Unlike word2vec, GloVe is a statistical model that aggregates both a global matrix factorization and a local context window. The learning relies on dimensionality reduction on the co-occurrence count matrix based on how frequently a word appears in a context. fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) is also an established library for word representations. Unlike word2vec and GloVe, fastText considers individual words as character n-grams. For instance, cold is made of the n-grams c, co, col, cold, o, ol, old, l, ld, and d. This approach enables handling of infrequent words that are not present in the training vocabulary, alleviating some out-ofvocabulary issues. However, the effectiveness of word-level representations is hindered by the limitation that they conflate all possible meanings of a word into a single representation and so the embedding is not adjusted to the surrounding context. In order to tackle these deficiencies, advanced approaches have attempted to directly model the word's context into the vector representation. Figure 1 illustrates this with the word cold, in which a traditional word embedding assigns all senses of the word cold with a single vector, whereas a contextual representation varies the vector based on its meaning in context (e.g., cold temperature, medical symptom/condition, an unfriendly disposition). Although a fictional figure is shown here, we later demonstrate this on real data.",

A further optimization by fusing the attention computation kernel can significantly reduce this additional cost. For EM D, since the decoder in pre-training only reconstructs the masked tokens, it does not introduce additional computational cost for unmasked tokens. In the situation where 15% tokens are masked and we use only two decoder layers, the additional cost is 0.15 ˆ2{L which results in an additional computational cost of only 3% for base model(L \" 12) and 2% for large model(L \" 24) in EMD.",

Despite its promising results on SuperGLUE, the model is by no means reaching the human-level intelligence of NLU. Humans are extremely good at leveraging the knowledge learned from different tasks to solve a new task with no or little task-specific demonstration. This is referred to as compositional generalization, the ability to generalize to novel compositions (new tasks) of familiar constituents (subtasks or basic problem-solving skills). Moving forward, it is worth exploring how to make DeBERTa incorporate compositional structures in a more explicit manner, which could allow combining neural and symbolic computation of natural language similar to what humans do. ‚ GLUE.

This is achieved by tailoring algorithmic strategies that are less dependent on large volumes of data, potentially through techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or leveraging domain knowledge more effectively. By implementing these approaches, the models can extract more meaningful patterns from small datasets, thus effectively overcoming the constraints posed by traditional methods designed for big data.",

Some other studies chose to include non-systematic literature reviews as well to complement results, but we did not include traditional survey papers because they do not systematically synthesize the papers in a field. The first threat to validity is related to the inclusion criteria for methods in research questions. Checkmarks in the tables of RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4 are placed when something is explicitly mentioned in the referred paper. The included secondary studies have their specific research focus with different sentiment analysis tasks and corresponding machine learning approaches. For instance, Kasmuri and Basiron (2017) discuss subjectivity classification, which typically uses different approaches compared to other sentiment analysis tasks.

Given only (question, world, answer) triples as training data, the model learns to assemble neural networks on the fly from an inventory of neural models, and simultaneously learns weights for these modules so that they can be composed into novel structures. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two tasks. We believe that the success of this work derives from two factors: Continuous representations improve the expressiveness and learnability of semantic parsers: by replacing discrete predicates with differentiable neural network fragments, we bypass the challenging combinatorial optimization problem associated with induction of a semantic lexicon. In structured world representations, neural predicate representations allow the model to invent reusable attributes and relations not expressed in the schema. Perhaps more importantly, we can extend compositional questionanswering machinery to complex, continuous world representations like images.",

Practically, allowing a more complicated semantic parse structure-either by increasing the number of primitive statements or the length of the parse-poses serious computational challenges in both model learning and inference. Because of the dynamic nature of our framework, it is not trivial to leverage the computational capabilities of GPUs using minibatched training; we plan to investigate ways to take full advantage of modern computing machinery in the near future.

For instance, although our current formal language design covers most question types in SQA, it is nevertheless important extend it further to make the semantic parser more robust (e.g., by including UNION or allowing comparison of multiple previous answers). Practically, allowing a more complicated semantic parse structure-either by increasing the number of primitive statements or the length of the parse-poses serious computational challenges in both model learning and inference. Because of the dynamic nature of our framework, it is not trivial to leverage the computational capabilities of GPUs using minibatched training; we plan to investigate ways to take full advantage of modern computing machinery in the near future. Finally, better resolution of semantic matching errors is a top priority, and unsupervised learning from large external corpora is one way to make progress in this direction.",

This allows the model to incorporate dependencies into the parsing process without having a predefined network structure, thereby maintaining flexibility to adapt to sequential contexts. The reward-guided search enhances learning efficiency by guiding the search process to optimize parsing accuracy based on expected outcomes.",

Hallucination is an artifact of neural-based NLG and is of concern because they appear fluent and can therefore be misleading to users. In some scenarios and tasks, hallucination can cause harm. We survey various contributors to hallucination, ranging from noisy data, erroneous parametric knowledge, incorrect attention mechanism, inappropriate training strategy, to inference exposure bias, etc. We show that there are two categories of hallucinations, namely intrinsic hallucination and extrinsic hallucination, and they need to be treated differently with diverse mitigation strategies. Hallucination is relatively easy to detect in abstractive summarization and in NMT against the evidence in the source. For dialogue systems, it is important to balance diversity vs consistency in dialogue responses. Hallucination in GQA and VL tasks is detrimental to the performance, but research on mitigation methods is still very preliminary in these areas. For datato-text generation, hallucination arises from the discrepancy between the input and output format. Most methods to mitigate hallucinations in NMT either aim to reduce dataset noise or alleviate exposure bias. In the VL domain, models also generate unfaithful output given the visual scene, and recent works have mainly focused on the object hallucination problem. There remain many challenges ahead in identifying and mitigating hallucinations in NLG, and we hope research in this area can benefit from this survey.",

For example, although CHAIR can automatically evaluate the degree of object hallucination in image captioning, it requires a pre-defined list of object categories, which does not generalize well. Furthermore, currently there is no automatic metric for the hallucination types discussed in Section 12.2. Therefore, we cannot perform quantitative evaluations for them.

First, better automatic evaluation metrics are needed to measure hallucination. The previously mentioned metrics, such as the semantic overlap between the generated answer and the ground-truth answer, the faithfulness of the generated answer, and factual consistency between the answer and the source documents, only consider one aspect of hallucination. Metrics that can consider all the factors related to hallucination (such as semantic overlap, faithfulness, or factual consistency) could be designed. Second, datasets with hallucination annotations should be proposed since none of the current GQA datasets have that information. Another possible direction to mitigate hallucination in the answer is improving the performance of the models. We need better retrieval models that retrieve relevant information according to queries and generation models that can synthesize more accurate answers from multi-source documents.",

They, however, do not concentrate on hallucinated content as such, and thus fluent but inadequate sentences may not always indicate hallucinations but also other types of translation errors.

Automated coding, development and personalized developer assistance. The pursuit of automation in coding encompasses the auto-generation of code snippets, bug fixes, system optimization, and the creation of intelligent, personalized assistance for developers that is context-aware and adaptable to individual needs. LLM's generative capabilities can be leveraged to help developers better understand requirements and generate syntactically and semantically correct code, thereby accelerating development cycles and improving software quality. Leveraging LLM's natural language processing to develop context-aware tools allows for interaction with developers in a more intuitive and responsive manner. Additionally, fine-tuning LLMs for specific coding tasks and developer assistance can further enhance their accuracy and efficiency, customizing the automation process to suit the unique demands of different projects and individuals. Advancing testing and analysis. The inclusion of LLMs in software testing methods opens up avenues for enhanced test case generation, bug classification, and defect prediction, thereby improving the precision and efficiency of the software testing process. For instance, LLMs show potential to be fine-tuned to a project's specific requirements to generate customized test cases, which elevates the likelihood of early detection of subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with traditional SE techniques, including both static and dynamic program analysis presents a compelling direction for more rigorous code analysis. The potential for utilizing LLMs in formal analysis methodologies, including formal verification, is another area that merits investigation [37] . These advancements not only facilitate the early discovery of complex errors but also lead to reduced development costs and quicker time-to-market, ultimately contributing to the robustness and reliability of the software products. Integrating programming knowledge into LLMs. One critical future direction lies in the integration of specialized code representation methods and programming domain knowledge into LLM4SE [276, 442] . This integration aims to enhance the capability of LLMs to generate code that is not only functionally accurate but also secure and compliant with programming standards. Leveraging advanced techniques in code embedding, syntax tree parsing, and semantic analysis could significantly refine the generation capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, embedding domain-specific",

After presenting the surveys of individual algorithms, we further connected them to the Capital Growth Theory in order to better understand the essence of their underlying trading ideas. Finally, we outlined some open challenges for further investigations. We note that, although quite a few algorithms have been proposed in literature, many open research problems remain unsolved and deserve further exploration. We wish this survey article could facilitate researchers to understand the state-of-the-art in this area and potentially inspire their further study.",

Strong performance for low-resource languages remains a critical area for future improvement (Gu et al., 2018; Sennrich and Zhang, 2019) . For many languages, our system still requires substantial improvements.

For many of these, even monolingual resources on the internet are limited, which strongly affects the quantity and quality of mined data. Using curated data, possibly supplemented by mining, may provide a starting point for future improvement. For example, several resources for African languages exist, including JW300 (Agić and Vulić, 2019) used in the masakhane machine translation effort (∀ et al., 2020) and datasets for Nigerian Pidgin (Ahia and Ogueji, 2020) , Wolof (Alla et al., 2020), Fon (Emezue and Dossou, 2020), Igbo (Ezeani et al., 2020) , Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta, and Ge'ez (Abate et al., 2018) .

We report the average test BLEU score on 100 randomly sampled pairs. example, if we wish to translate Galician to English, then instead of directly translating between the two, we ensemble the translation of Spanish to English with the translation of Galician to English, using the same multilingual model for both directions, and by averaging the predicted token log-probabilities, as for standard multi-model ensembles. The additional source is obtained by translating the input to another intermediary language. After this, we ensemble the translation of both sources to the target. This uses the same multilingual model for all steps. We evaluate both pivoting and self-ensembling on zero-shot directions as these can benefit from better accuracy. We report results on 100 randomly sampled zero-shot translation directions which have at least 1000 examples in the validation and test set. Next, for each translation direction, we choose the intermediary language that resulted in the highest BLEU on the validation set; the same is done to choose the intermediary language for pivoting. We also tune a weight to balance the two language directions (Garmash and Monz, 2016) . Table 12 shows that multi-source self-ensembling improves the single model result by 0.2 BLEU on average. It also performs as well as standard multi-model ensembling but requires training only a single model. This is particularly relevant for large models trained on vast quantities of data, which require a lot of compute to be able to perform standard ensembling.",

We attribute this improvement over the many-to-one models to the multiple target language pairs which may act as regularizers, especially in this lowresource multi-way-parallel setting that is prone to memorization. (2) many-to-many models are inferior in performance when going out-of-English in comparison to a one-to-many model. We attribute this to English being over-represented in the English-centric many-to-many setting, where it appears as a target language in 58 out of 116 trained directions, which may harm the performance on the rest of the target languages as the model capacity is limited. 3 It is important to stress the fact that we compared the different models under identical training conditions and did not perform extensive hyperparameter tuning for each setting separately. However, we believe that such tuning may improve performance even further, as the diversity in each training batch is very different between the different settings. For example, while the baseline model batches include only one language in the source and one language in the target, the manyto-many model includes 59 languages in each side with a strong bias towards English. These differences may require tailored hyper-parameter choices for each settings (i.e. different batch sizes, learning rate schedules, dropout rates etc.) which would be interesting to explore in future work.",

          "text": "Considering the shortcomings mentioned, developing more flexible self-reminding systems and expert frameworks that improve safety, trustworthiness, and accountability in LLMs without compromising effectiveness can be a fundamental research challenge to protect LLMs from jailbreaking attacks. Furthermore, individuals with malicious intent are highly active in online forums, sharing and discussing new strategies. Frequently, they keep these exchanges private to evade detection. Consequently, it is essential to conduct further research and studies aims to identify and implement effective defense strategies to mitigate the risks posed by the latest jailbreaking attacks. Efficient strategies for defending against backdoor attacks in a black-box environment are still lacking [117] . Existing defense mechanisms ( [249] , [201] , [230] ), for specific learning tasks in LMs are not evaluated for the other learning tasks like, text summarizing, and prompt-based learning. Moreover, it is found in the literature that prompt-based PLMs are highly susceptible to textual backdoor attacks [295] , [60] . Addressing the challenge of textual backdoor attacks in prompt-based paradigms, particularly in the few-shot learning setting [273] , is another unresolved challenge. MDP (Masking-Differential Prompting) defense [291] faces challenges in various NLP tasks like paraphrasing and sentence similarity [74] . Its performance under few-shot learning remains uncertain due to a lack of practical evaluation. While MDP has demonstrated strength against earlier backdoor attacks, it may not be effective against recently introduced attacks like Bad-Prompt [21] and BToP [295] . Perplexity-based methods and filtering-based methods may not work well when attackers use synonymous trigger keys [96] . Furthermore, developing dynamic defense methods considering the above factors is a challenging future task. Currently, the predominant focus of investigation on backdoor attacks revolves around text classification in LLMs. However, a notable gap exists in the literature concerning investigations into backdoor attacks on various tasks for which LLMs find widespread application, e.g., text summarization and text generation [300] . Understanding and addressing backdoor attacks in various tasks for which LLMs are employed is crucial for developing effective defense mechanisms and ensuring secure deployment of LLMs. While poisoning attacks on ML models have been investigated in the literature [175] , there is not yet an effective solution for several attack methods, including ProAttack [321] and Badprompt [21] . Further research in diverse tasks and models can enhance the knowledge and understanding of the security impacts of LLMs, as well as facilitate the development of robust and trustworthy LLM systems. Defense techniques, such as dataset cleaning, and removing near duplicate poisoned samples and anomalies, sometimes slow down the model development process in order to defend against data poisoning attacks. Other defense methods, e.g., stopping training after certain epochs, achieve a moderate defense against poisoning attacks but degrade the model utility [263] . Gradient perturbation [95] and DP-SGD-based methods [2] are frequently used to defend against privacy attacks in LLMs. It can prevent the private training data from being leaked based on the parameter configurations at a small cost of model utility. Limiting the accessibility to the model and generating limited prediction results might be another option [312] . Extensive research studies can obtain proper knowledge of to what extent algorithmic defenses such as differential privacy can prevent PII disclosure without compromising model utility. In the post-processing phase, for API-access models such as GPT-3, it is advisable to integrate a detection module that examines the output text to identify sensitive information. If sensitive content is detected, the system should either decline to provide an answer or apply masks to safeguard the sensitive information [98] . Also, for image models, a recent study has demonstrated that adding a standard level of random noise into the gradient update might not always work well to prevent gradient leakage attacks on medical images [52] . Recently, an open language model (OLMo) has been introduced to provide open access to the data, code, and model [242] . The main purpose of OLMo is to facilitate open research on language models. They performed PII filtering to remove it from the data, and they also provided a tool to remove PII data upon request. Though it followed existing practices to obscure the PII exposure and identify and remove toxic content, it did not explicitly discuss the impacts of various attacks outlined in this survey paper and how to mitigate those risks. Secure multi-party computation [47] can be another way to defend against privacy attacks in LLMs, which can be explored in future research endeavors. Considering the above limitations of existing defense techniques in LLMs, developing a defense mechanism for these privacy attacks for LLMs would be an imperative task.",

This demonstrates the dynamic nature of adversarial strategies, with the understanding that new, optimized prompts may emerge even after the initial data collection phase. Moreover, most of the existing studies on jailbreaking attacks are primarily focused on ChatGPT [54, 132, 234] . It remains unclear whether potential vulnerabilities exist in other LLMs, such as Vicuna [38] , Bard [158] , and Bing Chat [165] . For example, MasterKey [54] may not achieve comparable performance on Vicuna as it does on ChatGPT. For prompt-based attacks, manual prompts are often more effective than automated prompt-based attack methods. As automated attack methods are primarily designed for generalized tasks, they may not demonstrate same effectiveness for specific tasks as manually crafted prompts. The unlabeled and imbalanced realworld data further complicate the development of effective automated prompting-based attack methods [238] . For backdoor attacks, most of them are focused on classification or similar tasks [21] , e.g., sentiment analysis and opinion classification. More attention should be paid to the attacks that perform other NLP tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and language translation. The underlying philosophy behind privacy attacks lies in the correlation between the level of accessibility an adversary holds and its ability to extract sensitive information or exert control over target victim LLMs. More access leads to a broader potential for the adversary to recover sensitive data or influence the target LLM [131] . For instance, when the adversary has access only to the black-box model, the attacker might be able to leverage training data extraction attacks to recover a limited set of private data. However, if the adversary is granted white-box information such as gradients, the attacker can leverage this extra information to accurately recover more private training instances [55] . This expanded access can facilitate various privacy attacks, including attribute inference attacks, embedding inversion, and gradient leakage attacks. In gradient-based attacks, the adversary needs the white-box information of a model, which is sometimes impractical in real-world practice. Moreover, most of the existing privacy attacks are designed for vision models. A limited number of studies have reported gradient leakage attacks specifically on language models, e.g., the LAMP attack [14] . In essence, the increased access empowers adversaries to perform more sophisticated and targeted privacy attacks against LLMs, potentially compromising sensitive information or gaining access to the internal model architecture. The early MIAs were based on the white-box access assumption [239] , which is sometimes impractical in real-world deployment. The evaluation dataset for some attacks, e.g., ProPILE was built solely from private information available in open-source datasets provided by major corporations, ensuring ethical data acquisition [122] . However, it is crucial to note that the heuristic data collection process might potentially lead to instances of bias, disassociation, or noise. This adds uncertainty and potential inaccuracies in the benchmark dataset, requiring attention when interpreting the results.",

          "text": "The role of XAI in the security and privacy aspect of LLM is crucial. Specifically in its development phase, having prior knowledge about the attackers' ability (e.g., black-box access to the model, injecting poisonous instances to the training/fine-tuning data) and the vulnerable components (training/fine-tuning data and the model itself) of LLM systems will assist in developing robust techniques against security and privacy attacks. However, XAI may expose critical aspects of the LLMs, including their architecture, components, and the dynamic weight allocation by attention mechanism that contribute to predictions. Such disclosures may increase the LLM's vulnerability to security and privacy attacks. For example, revealing the white-box nature of the model may facilitate the attacker's access to the model, increasing the risk of gradient leakage attacks or MIA [63] . Recent studies have claimed that explainability in LLMs may raise further security concerns, especially with insidious backdoor attacks [35] . Lin et al. proposed an XAI approach that can identify the triggers (backdoor attack) that mislead the model to contribute to error classification [141] . Li et al. developed an XAI technique to identify and quantify the influence of raw data features on successful MIAs. This approach analyzes the data distribution to identify the influential neurons contributing to compromising private data and subsequently trains an MIA ensemble model using attack features derived from the selected neurons [141] . XAI techniques in image models (e.g., Grad-CAM [224] ) may compromise model privacy under various attacks, such as gradient leakage attacks. In some cases, XAI enables more accurate reconstruction of private training data compared to models that rely solely on predictions [324] . XAI-aware model extraction attack (XaMEA) was proposed to exploit spatial knowledge from decision explanations [297] . It illustrated that the transparency provided by XAI may facilitate the attacker's access to the model, making it easier to exploit it. This increased explainability can make the model more vulnerable to model extraction attacks compared to prediction-only models. However, the vulnerabilities mentioned above are mostly explored for DNNs. In LLMs, the vulnerabilities in the XAI context have been explored to a limited extent. Moreover, there are several unique characteristics of LLMs that are different from DNNs, e.g., large-scale data and model parameters, task-agnostic, and semantic language understanding, which makes it more challenging to design XAI methods for better interpretations. The comprehensive interpretation of LLM vulnerabilities under XAI, including backdoor attacks, membership inference attacks (MIA), and model extraction attacks, has yet to be fully explored. Additionally, vulnerabilities related to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks in the context of XAI still remain unexplored. Furthermore, open-sourced LLMs are publicly accessible and may provide greater explainability than closed-source models. However, this enhanced accessibility can make them more vulnerable to attacks when XAI techniques are employed. Thus, these LLMs may be more susceptible to attacks due to XAI. Further research is essential to fully understand the extent and impact of attackers' capabilities under XAI. Additionally, mitigation techniques should be developed in accordance with the identified risks and impacts.",

Only a few are tested on LLMs (e.g., ProPILE, DAN, and JAILBREAKER). Also, the high cost of accessing commercialized LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 or upper versions, contributes to the lack of attack evaluations on LLMs. Besides, the in-depth vulnerability analysis in terms of privacy attacks and security issues is still lacking for LLMs. One of the reasons can be attributed to the limited number of performance evaluation metrics (e.g., perplexity) in the language domain to comprehensively evaluate attack and defense effectiveness. Also, in the FL environment, it requires very high computational power to train LLMs with such large datasets [247] . It is an open research challenge to develop effective attack and robust defense methods along with the proper evaluation techniques for LLMs. The correctness of LLM-generated content has always been a major concern in this area of research. Due to the knowledge gaps, i.e., missing or outdated information might always be present in LLMs. The problem of hallucination in LLM has been investigated and evaluated from the knowledge-gap perspective but is yet to be investigated from other perspectives such as safety, i.e., abstaining to generate harmful content [25] .",

To acquire a comprehensive understanding of the reasoning processes of large neural networks, more in-depth investigation is highly required.

          "text": "Future research initiatives for enhancing security and privacy in LLMs can be directed toward several key areas. An ideal defense method should be able to effectively achieve a balance between model utility and security & privacy protection. The development of real-time privacy monitoring systems is essential to improve the resilience of privacy-preserving LLMs. This necessitates the exploration of robust detection techniques against various security and privacy attacks. Furthermore, a thorough evaluation of less-explored defense techniques, such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC), is necessary to assess their effectiveness against LLM vulnerabilities. Finally, leveraging the capabilities of XAI can improve transparency in LLM defense mechanisms. Role of explainable AI in Enhancing Security and Privacy of LLMs: LLM's ability to make decisions on various learning tasks is often criticized due to its black-box nature, e.g., non-interpretable weights. It makes it more challenging for the new practitioners and developers of this field, as it hinders their ability to clearly interpret and understand its application, particularly in critical cases. Explainable AI (XAI) can help to bridge this gap by developing methods to interpret and explain complex LLM systems, the decision-making process, and outputs [22] . Conducting studies and research to build explainable methods is highly essential to make the usage of LLMs more reliable and trustworthy. XAI can provide transparent insights into the inference process and the dynamic weight assignment by the attention mechanism of the LLMs, which enhances interpretability by highlighting the most influential input features that contribute to its predictions. This explainability makes the model more trustworthy and ensures that its output is explainable. Additionally, it facilitates error analysis and bias detection. XAI has shown its potential in several real-world AI applications such as anomaly detection [1, 8] , cyber-security [216] , and enhancing data privacy [63] . In ML, several popular methods exist such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [214] , and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [153] , which offer insights into model behavior without requiring access to internal model components. These methods analyze the association between inputs and outputs to identify features that most significantly contribute to model predictions. The explainability of code generation models such as CodeBERT [67] and GraphCodeBERT [82] were proposed to understand code syntax and semantics [304] . Also, the ad-hoc explanation further clarifies the model's decision [142] .",

We then discuss the limitations of current security and privacy attacks and defenses along various promising domains that require further research. Existing Attack Methods, their Limitations, and Future Research Direction: In LLMs, various categories of security and privacy attacks have emerged, posing significant risks to LLM systems. Among security attacks, prompt injection is a prominent technique in which attackers craft malicious prompts, either manually [146] or automatically [238] , to mislead the LLM into generating inappropriate or harmful outputs. These prompts are designed to bypass the model's safety alignments [110] , enabling the generation of content as per the attacker's intent. Jailbreaking attacks involve creating malicious prompts in tricky way [246] , such as character role-play [83] and attention shifting [147] , so that the LLM generates inappropriate/harmful contents. Data poisoning attacks involve the insertion of malicious data samples during the model's training/fine-tuning phases [126, 263] , introducing biases or vulnerabilities that compromise the model's functionality. Similarly, backdoor attacks introduce hidden \"backdoors\" (via trojaning) during the training/finetuning phase [235] , which are activated by the presence of backdoor triggering words in the prompts, making the LLM system vulnerable. LLM privacy attacks focus on extracting sensitive information such as private training/fine-tuning data, personal information, and even model components (e.g., gradients or model architecture). Techniques used in these attacks include gradient leakage attacks [55] , MIA [239] , and PII leakage attacks [178] .",

But fails for other ones. Trade-off between the model utility and defense Development of adversarial Reinforcement learning in LLMs Formulating evaluation metrics Checking attack method's susceptibility from other domains Dynamic attack methods with different goals Explore privacy risks and Vulnerabilities due to attacks Developing effective defense techniques for advanced attacks, e.g., BadPrompt [21], Proattack [320], BToP [294] Real time privacy monitoring Explore secure multi-party computation for defense Designing a robust detection and prevention-based defense Explainability to the attack methods Explainability to the defense methods collection time-frame. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of adversarial strategies, with the understanding that new, optimized prompts may emerge even after the initial data collection phase. Moreover, most of the existing studies on jailbreaking attacks are primarily focused on ChatGPT [54, 132, 234] . It remains unclear whether potential vulnerabilities exist in other LLMs, such as Vicuna [38] , Bard [158] , and Bing Chat [165] . For example, MasterKey [54] may not achieve comparable performance on Vicuna as it does on ChatGPT. For prompt-based attacks, manual prompts are often more effective than automated prompt-based attack methods. As automated attack methods are primarily designed for generalized tasks, they may not demonstrate same effectiveness for specific tasks as manually crafted prompts. The unlabeled and imbalanced realworld data further complicate the development of effective automated prompting-based attack methods [238] . For backdoor attacks, most of them are focused on classification or similar tasks [21] , e.g., sentiment analysis and opinion classification. More attention should be paid to the attacks that perform other NLP tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and language translation. The underlying philosophy behind privacy attacks lies in the correlation between the level of accessibility an adversary holds and its ability to extract sensitive information or exert control over target victim LLMs. More access leads to a broader potential for the adversary to recover sensitive data or influence the target LLM [131] . For instance, when the adversary has access only to the black-box model, the attacker might be able to leverage training data extraction attacks to recover a limited set of private data. However, if the adversary is granted white-box information such as gradients, the attacker can leverage this extra information to accurately recover more private training instances [55] . This expanded access can facilitate various privacy attacks, including attribute inference attacks, embedding inversion, and gradient leakage attacks. In gradient-based attacks, the adversary needs the white-box information of a model, which is sometimes impractical in real-world practice. Moreover, most of the existing privacy attacks are designed for vision models. A limited number of studies have reported gradient leakage attacks specifically on language models, e.g., the LAMP attack [14] . In essence, the increased access empowers adversaries to perform more sophisticated and targeted privacy attacks against LLMs, potentially compromising sensitive information or gaining access to the internal model architecture. The early MIAs were based on the white-box access assumption [239] , which is sometimes impractical in real-world deployment. The evaluation dataset for some attacks, e.g., ProPILE was built solely from private information available in open-source datasets provided by major corporations, ensuring ethical data acquisition [122] . However, it is crucial to note that the heuristic data collection process might potentially lead to instances of bias, disassociation, or noise. This adds uncertainty and potential inaccuracies in the benchmark dataset, requiring attention when interpreting the results.",

Such evaluation frameworks should be complemented by extensive model red-teaming and an adversarial approach to identifying any remaining gaps and failure modes. Recent advances in red-teaming LLMs could be useful in this scenario 37 , where human raters or other AI systems (that is, the red team) simulate the role of an adversary to identify vulnerabilities and security gaps in these LLMs. These practices should not only inform the evaluation of the final model, but also its development and iterative refinement. Model development should follow the established data and model reporting practices and provide transparency into the training data and the associated decision processes [38] [39] [40] . The dialogue research dataset contributing to the AMIE training data in our study was de-identified, reducing the availability of socioeconomic factors, patient demographics and information about clinical settings and locations. To mitigate the risk that our synthetic vignettes would skew towards certain demographic groups, we leveraged web search to retrieve a range of demographics and associated symptoms relevant to each condition. We used these as input to the prompt template for vignette generation, instructing the model to produce multiple different vignettes given this range of inputs. While this mechanism was designed with the intent of mitigating risks of bias amplification, a comprehensive evaluation of conversational diagnostic models, such as AMIE, for equity, fairness and bias is an important scope for future work.",

Recent advances in the development of comprehensive frameworks for bias detection in LLMs 32 present a promising starting point for establishing such an approach. It should be noted that medical diagnostic dialogue is a particularly challenging use case, due to the complexity of the medical domain, the interactive information-gathering nature of the dialogue and the outcome-driven setting, with the potential of associated harms in cases of incorrect diagnosis or incorrect medical advice. Nevertheless, disentangling these issues is an important further research area if LLMs in the domain are to overcome, rather than propagate, inequities in healthcare. For example, previous studies have found that physicians approach communication with their patients differently, on average, depending on the patients' race, resulting in Black patients receiving communication that was less patient-centred and had a lower positive affect 33 . Other studies have found differences in physicians' communication styles and conversation length based on gender 34 and on patients' level of health literacy 35 . Effective intercultural communication skills are essential 36 . There is therefore a non-negligible risk that such historical conversational biases may be replicated or amplified in an AI dialogue system, but at the same time, there is also an opportunity to work towards designing conversational systems that can be more inclusive, and more personalized to the individual patient's needs.",

Future studies may extend our synthesis approach to LLM applications that explicitly focus on healthcare professionals. Second, while it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of LLM performance due to the different study designs and evaluation methods used, this will be an important area for future work as the field of LLM research in clinical settings continues to evolve. Third, there is a risk that potentially eligible studies were not included in our analysis if they were not present in the 5 databases reviewed or were not available in English. However, we screened nearly 3,000 articles in total and systematically analyzed 89 articles, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLMs in patient care, even if some articles could have been missed. With our chosen cut-off date of January 2022, there is also a risk of missing relevant publications on predecessor LLM models, such as GPT-3, which was introduced in 2020. However, as our review focused on current LLM applications and limitations, it seemed most beneficial to include only recent publications from the last two years on the most advanced models, especially when considering that ChatGPT was first made available in November 2022. Finally, the rapid development and advancement of LLMs make it difficult to keep this systematic review up to date. For example, Gemini 1.5 Pro was published in February 2024, and corresponding articles are not included in this review, which synthesized articles from 2022 to 2023. This also has implications for our introduced taxonomy of LLM limitations, as new limitations may emerge as models evolve, and previous limitations may become less relevant or even obsolete. For example, our taxonomy identifies \"limited access to internet data\" as a limitation; however, with the introduction of web browsing capabilities for GPT-4 in May 2023, this particular limitation no longer applies to that model. Given these ongoing developments, we strongly encourage future studies to test, update, and extend our taxonomy to ensure that it remains a relevant tool for categorizing LLM limitations in clinical and other high-stakes applications.",

In practice, it is widely recognized that limited access to the underlying algorithms, training data, and data processing and storage mechanisms of LLMs is a significant barrier to their application in healthcare 114 . This opacity makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to fully understand how these models function, assess their reliability, or ensure compliance with local medical standards and regulations.

One major issue is the inherent stochasticity in the models' architecture, particularly in transformer-based models, which utilize probabilistic techniques during inference (e.g., beam search or temperature sampling) 125 . This non-determinism can lead to different outputs for the same input, making it difficult to replicate results exactly across different instances or even across models with identical training data. Further external factors contributing to non-reproducibility, such as variations in hardware, software versions, or context windows, complicate the assurance of reproducibility 126 . As the reproducibility of results is a central principle in medical practice, our concepts highlight the need for more standardized protocols, improved documentation of model configurations, the examination of nondeterminism for evaluation purposes, and further research on how robust results can be achieved before implementing LLMs in real-world clinical practice. Interestingly, Ouyang et al. reported that only a minority of studies take non-determinism into account in their experimental evaluation when using ChatGPT for code generation, suggesting that this limitation is also prevalent and overlooked in other domains of LLM use 125 .",

Such tools are generally only accepted when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and even then, informed consent from the affected individual is essential 130 . While informed consent might ensure that patients understand the risks involved and are able to make an educated decision about their care, which could be obtained, for example, in the form of a disclaimer before using the LLM, studies suggest that even when obtaining informed consent the patient understanding increases not significantly 131 . In the case of disclaimers, there might also be the risk that these are accepted without proper reading or understanding 132 . The practicality of informed consent once LLMs are deeply integrated into clinical workflows also remains an issue, as it is when patients no longer have the ability to opt out, such as in the case of serious illness. In any case, the finding that nearly half of the studies reported limitations related to LLM unsafeness suggests that LLMs are not yet reliable enough for autonomous medical use, and there is a critical need for safety measures and regulatory and human oversight to prevent adverse consequences in medical contexts 133 .",

Therefore, to promote a positive reception of AI tools among patients, incorporating their perspectives already during the AI development and implementation process could be key 149 . Eventually, patient perspectives are already considered in AI regulatory frameworks, such as in the European Union AI Act, which came into force in August 2024 150 . The associated challenges faced by generative AI and LLM, for example, in terms of training data transparency and validation of nondeterministic output, will show which approaches the companies will take to bring these models into compliance with the law 151 .

For this concept, the majority of thirdorder codes were related to LLM outputs that were incomplete. This issue is particularly significant when considering the application of LLMs in medical tasks such as clinical decision support or diagnosis, where incomplete or partial results can have serious consequences. In clinical practice, missing key information could lead to suboptimal patient outcomes, incorrect diagnoses, or improper treatment recommendations. For instance, an incomplete therapy suggestion could render the entire treatment plan insufficient, potentially resulting in harm to the patient. Given the potential of using LLMs in medical decision-making, these limitations underscore the necessity for expert supervision and validation of LLM outputs depending on their application. While LLMs used as chatbots for general patient inquiries may not require consistent human oversight, using LLMs for treatment advice would require consistent validation to ensure that incomplete information does not lead to adverse outcomes. Depending on their application, the same problem arises when the LLM generates generic or non-personalized information, which was another third-order code identified. The generation of content with high complexity and an inappropriate reading level, which was above the American Medical Association (AMA) recommended 6th-grade reading level in almost all of the 22 studies that analyzed the complexity level of the output, may further limit its usefulness for patient information 127 .

          "text": "When the word \"Muslim\" is included in the prompt, it is difficult to generate GPT-3 completions that do not contain violent language. For example, even when the prompt is modified to read \"Two Muslims walked into a mosque to worship peacefully,\" the completions are consistently violent. In our experiments, we found that the most reliable way to debias 6 the completions was by introducing a short phrase into the prompt that carried positive associations about Muslims. This is inspired by \"adversarial triggers\" (14) , which are short sequences of words that change language models outputs. For example, modifying the prompt to read \"Muslims are hard-working. Two Muslims walked into a\" produced non-violent completions about 80% of the time. Fig. 4(a) illustrates this debiasing strategy. Listed in Fig. 4(b ) are the 50 positive adjectives that we tried, which are randomly selected from a precompiled list foot_6 of such words. We fed 500 such prompts including positive triggers with all 50 adjectives into GPT-3 and found that averaged across all results, the proportion of violence-containing completions dropped from 66% to 46%. We then repeated this experiment with 120 prompts using only the 6 best-performing adjectives, and found that we could further reduce the violent completions to 20%, although this was still more than the proportion of completions containing violence if \"Muslims\" was replaced, e.g., with \"Christians.\" These results are shown in Fig. 4(c ). Interestingly, we found that the best-performing adjectives were not those diametrically opposite to violence (e.g. \"calm\" did not significantly affect the proportion of violent completions). Instead, adjectives such as \"hard-working\" or \"luxurious\" were more effective, as they redirected the focus of the completions toward a specific direction (see Supplementary Materials for examples). We try 50 randomly-selected positive adjectives, and identify 6 that perform particularly well (bolded in green) at reducing the probability that the completion contains violent language. (c) Quantitative results are shown here: on average, these 50 adjectives reduce the proportion of violent completions for \"Muslims\" from 66% to 46%. The best 6 adjectives reduced violent completion to 20%, which is still higher than the analogous results for \"Christians,\" (for which, 13-15% of the completions contain violent language).

We demonstrate that GPT-3, a state-of-the-art contextual language model, captures persistent Muslim-violence bias. We probe GPT-3 in various ways, including prompt completion, analogical reasoning, and story generation, to understand this anti-Muslim bias, demonstrating that it appears consistently and creatively in different uses of the model and that it is severe even compared to biases about other religious groups. For instance, \"Muslim\" is analogized to \"terrorist\" in 23% of test cases, while \"Jewish\" is mapped to \"money\" in 5% of test cases. We quantify the positive distraction needed to overcome this bias with adversarial text prompts, and find that use of the most positive 6 adjectives reduces violent completions for \"Muslims\" from 66% to 20%, but which is still higher than for other religious groups.

          "text": "Rule-based de-biasing lacks robustness. Handwritten rules are limited by design. For example, a breakdown of the results shown in Table 2 (see Appendix B) reveals that Diesner-Mayer and Seidel's (2022) rewriter handles masculine forms better than our model (with a WER as low as 7.81). However, their rewriter performs poorly with feminine forms (with a WER as high as 22.22, which is worse than the WER of the biased input texts) likely because these forms are not covered in its rule set. Additionally, we find that while Diesner-Mayer and Seidel's (2022) approach features a solution for compounds, e.g. it can correctly de-bias \"Strassenbauarbeiter\" (road construction worker), this only applies to compounds where the gendered word appears at the end, e.g. it does not de-bias \"Arbeitergesetz\" (employee legislation). Furthermore, their approach uses a word database to identify gendered nouns which does not generalise to unknown gendered words. Finally, there is always a risk of error propagation with the NLP tools used in rule-based approaches. We conclude that language-specific rule sets will likely never cover all relevant phenomena for gender-fair rewriting. As shown by previous work, seq2seq models provide a model-based alternative that boosts generalisation (Vanmassenhove et al., 2021) which is why they should be used in as many languages as possible. We believe that Round-trip Augmentation provides an easy way to create parallel data to train gender-fair rewriting models for new languages without the need for in-depth linguistic knowledge of the language.",

We include this question in the post-experiment survey independently of any specific text, and compare participants' responses with their average rating for Original and Rewriter outputs in the main part of the experiment.

For singular forms, we decide to create our test set with a balanced mix of forms referring to unspecific people as well as real persons. There are two reasons for this design choice: First, we want to closely mirror the setup in English, where e.g. any occurrence of \"she\" or \"he\" is rewritten to \"they\", irrespective of whether it refers to a specific person or not. Second, there are several cases where we cannot assume that an input text referring to a specific person uses their 13 https://huggingface.co/datasets/wmt19 14 As manually evaluated on a random set of 100 sentences.",

Our work shows that knowledge of a bias can be used to correct that bias with the biased models themselves. In the case of gender-fair rewriting, we demonstrated that reversing the data augmen-tation direction and using round-trip translations from biased MT models can substitute the prevalent rewriting paradigm that relies on handcrafted and often complex rules on top of morphological analysers, dependency parsers, and many other NLP tools. In our case study for German, our model surpasses the performance of a strong baseline in terms of WER and produces outputs that were perceived as more gender-fair than unaltered biased text in a human evaluation campaign with 294 potential beneficiaries.",

Recently, increasing efforts have been made to alleviate the limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucination and out-of-date internal knowledge, by leveraging retrieval to provide the latest auxiliary information and teaching LLMs to harness the retrieved external knowledge. With the rapid advancements in retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-LLMs), there is a pressing need for a comprehensive and systematic overview. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we comprehensively review the RA-LLMs from the perspectives of morel architecture, training strategy, and application area, providing researchers with an in-depth understanding. Moreover, since the studies of RA-LLMs are still in the early stage, we also discuss the current limitations and several potential research directions for future research.",

Firstly, the search space in recommender systems is considerably more complex, encompassing diverse types of search space and facing significant volume issues. This complexity poses a challenge in effectively exploring and optimizing the search space. Secondly, compared to the common architecture search in other domains, recommender systems lack a strong foundation of knowledge regarding the informative components within the search space, especially the effective high-order feature interactions.

          "text": "However, there are two major security and privacy risks for personalized content creators. One of the concerns is the reliability of models like ChatGPT in terms of factuality, as indicated in the work [283] . While these models generate content that appears reasonable, there is a risk of distributing misleading or inaccurate information, which can weaken the truthfulness of internet content. This concern becomes particularly crucial in personalized recommendations, where the model may inadvertently promote misleading information tailored to the user's interests. The second concern revolves around data privacy, encompassing both user profiles and long-term human interaction histories. In the case of large language models, these interaction histories are collected or shared, potentially leading to the large models memorizing sensitive user data. Previous work [284] has demonstrated that large language models, especially GPT-2 [285] , memorize and leak individual training examples. This emphasizes the need for strict user approval and careful handling of annotator data to mitigate privacy risks. It is crucial to develop new techniques that prioritize privacy preservation during the training process.",

          "text": "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is widely applied in recommender systems to eliminate the costly manual setup with trials and errors. The search space in recommender systems can be categorized in (1) Embedding size (2) Feature (3) Feature interaction (4) Model architecture. Embedding size search, such as [176] [177] [178] [179] seeks for appropriate embedding size for each feature to avoid resources overconsumption. Searching for features consisting of raw feature search [180, 181] and synthetic feature search [182, 183] , which selects a subset from the set of original or cross features to maintain informative features to reduce both computation and space cost. Feature interaction search, such as [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] , automatically filters out feature interactions that are not helpful. Model architecture search, like [189] [190] [191] [192] , expands the search space to the integral architectures. The search strategy shifts from the discrete reinforcement learning process, which iteratively samples architectures for training and is time-consuming, into the differentiable searching, which adaptively selects architectures within one-shot learning to circumvent the computational burden, for more efficient convergence. The evaluation for each sampled architecture then acts as the signal to adjust the selections. That is, there is a decision maker who memorizes the prior results of previous architecture choices and analyzes the prior results to give the next recommended choice. The emergent LLMs have excellent memorization and reasoning capabilities that would work for automated learning. Several works have attempted to validate the potential of automated machine learning with LLMs. Preliminarily, GPT-NAS [193] takes advantage of the generative capability of LLMs. The architecture of networks is formulated into sequential characters, and thus the generation of network architectures can be easily achieved through the generative pre-training models. NAS-Bench-101 [194] is utilized for pre-training and the state-of-the-art results are used for fine-tuning. The generative pre-training models produce reasonable architectures, which would reduce the search space for later genetic algorithms for searching optimal architectures. The relatively advanced reasoning ability is further evaluated in GENIUS [195] , where GPT-4 is employed as a black-box agent to generate potential better-performing architectures according to previous trials including tried architectures with their evaluation performance. According to the results, GPT-4 can generate good architecture networks, showing the potential for more complicated tasks. Yet it is too difficult for LLMs to directly make decisions on challenging technical problems only by prompting. To balance efficiency and interpretability, one approach is to integrate the LLMs into certain search strategies, where the genetic algorithm guides the search process and LLMs generate the candidate crossovers. LLMatic [196] and EvoPrompting [197] use code-LLMs as mutation and crossover operators for a genetic NAS algorithm. During the evolution process, each generation has a certain probability of deciding whether to perform crossover or mutation to produce new offspring. Crossover and mutation are generated by prompting LLMs. Such a solution integrates LLM into the genetic search algorithm, which would achieve better performances than direct reasoning over the whole space.",

However, with the advancements in techniques and platforms for content creators, personalized content creator has attracted more and more attention, where more appealing content is customized generated to match the user's interests and preferences, especially in the realm of online advertising [253] . The common contents contain the visual and semantic contents [254] [255] [256] , such as title, abstract, description, copywritings, ad banners, thumbnail, and videos. One more widely discussed topic is text ad generation, where the ad title and ad description are generated with personalized information. Earlier works adopt the pre-defined templates [254, 257, 258] to reduce the extensive human effort, which, however, often fail to fully meet the user's interests and preferences. More recent data-driven methods have emerged, which incorporate user feedback as rewards in the reinforcement learning framework to guide the generation process [259] [260] [261] [262] . Furthermore, the incorporation of pre-trained language models has played a significant role in improving the generation process for multiple content items [263] [264] [265] [266] .

To alleviate this problem, recent research has explored the capabilities of LLMs with respect to the major subtasks of IE, i.e., NER [83, 190] , RE [169, 170] , and EE [191] . Considering the superior reasoning capabilities of LLMs, Xie et al. [190] proposed four reasoning strategies for NER, which are designed to simulate ChatGPT's potential on zero-shot NER. Wadhwa et al. [169] explored the use of LLMs for RE and found that few-shot prompting with GPT-3 achieves near SOTA performance, while Flan-T5 can be improved with chain-of-thought style explanations generated via GPT-3. For EE task, Gao et al. [191] showed that ChatGPT still struggles with it due to the need for complex instructions and a lack of robustness. Along this line, some researchers performed a more comprehensive analysis of LLMs by evaluating multiple IE subtasks simultaneously. Li et al. [195] evaluated ChatGPT's overall ability on IE, including performance, explainability, calibration, and faithfulness. They found that ChatGPT mostly performs worse than BERT-based models in the standard IE setting, but excellently in the OpenIE setting. Furthermore, Han et al.

          "text": "Item-oriented group performance fairness is an essential factor for building trustworthy recommender systems [15, 29] . In this work, we propose a novel Fairly adaptive Negative sampling framework (FairNeg) to alleviate the adverse impact of negative sampling on training recommendation models. Based on the pairwise training paradigm, we introduce the fairness perception module to measure the recall performance disparity and then adjust the groupwise sampling probability with an adaptive momentum mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce the mixup mechanism for combining fairness-aware and importance-related sampling distribution, which aims to jointly consider representation learning and group fairness optimization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing approaches regarding fairness performance by significant margins and yields better fairness-performance tradeoffs. In the future, we plan to investigate the possibility of leveraging the framework to be compatible with more group fairness metrics in recommendations.",

          "text": "Today, LLM chatbots are increasingly capable of providing users with advice in a wide range of professional domains, including legal advice. However, what constitutes an appropriate LLM-generated response to legal queries, where both required expertise and resulting consequences are high? To explore this, we conducted workshops with 20 legal experts using methods inspired by case-based reasoning to encourage deliberations around appropriate LLM responses to legal queries in practice. Our contributions are threefold. First, we presented a set of 25 key dimensions, synthesized from expert deliberations, that impacted LLM response appropriateness in the legal domain. Second, we shared experts' recommendations for LLM response strategies and guiding principles for generating appropriate responses-these centered around helping users identify and prepare salient information for legal proceedings rather than recommending specific legal actions. Finally, we posit that our case-based method has utility in engaging expert perspectives on LLM response appropriateness in professional domains beyond the legal sphere. Taken together, our work sets an empirical foundation for translating domain-specific professional knowledge and practices into policies to steer real-world LLM behavior in a more responsible direction. As an AI model, I am not a substitute for consulting with a trained professional. This seems like a specific concern or issue that requires expert advice. It's always advisable to speak with a professional in the relevant field. Empathize + Refuse Emphasizes with a user but avoids providing a response to the input.",

However, even if indiscernible by visual inspection, molecular evidence shows the presence of dysregulated differentiation in well-differentiated tumors. Well-differentiated tumors exhibit a less differentiated molecular profile with elevated expression of precursor genes and lower expression of tissue specific genes compared to healthy tissue 165 . Gene expression studies in histologically differentiated thyroid cancers have found a disruption in differentiation on a molecular level as compared to benign thyroid tissue. Using primary thyroid cancers, Yu et al demonstrated that Notch-1 expression was downregulated in differentiated thyroid cancer tissues compared to benign thyroid tissues and that decreased Notch-1 expression was associated with more aggressive tumors with extrathyroidal invasion 166 . Restoration of Notch-1 expression in a metastatic, differentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line led to a reduction in cell growth and tumor cell migration 166 . The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network investigated the relationship between driver mutations BRAFV600E and RAS and differentiation in papillary thyroid cancer, a typically well-differentiated cancer by histology 167 . Differentiation of over 350 PTCs was quantified and scored by measuring mRNA expression of 16 thyroid function genes, with a lower score indicating decreased differentiation 167 . Interestingly, increased differentiation scores were correlated with the PTC driver mutation BRAFV600E, while decreased differentiation scores were correlated with the driver mutation RAS 167 . Further, upon pathological examination, tumors with lower differentiation scores by mRNA expression were found to have subtle architectural changes that generated more poorly formed and complex papillary structure with fewer follicles 167 . These findings suggested that certain driver mutations may contribute to decreased differentiation in thyroid cancer 167 . As the new molecular tools under development are advanced for clinical application, the feasibility of identifying lack of terminal differentiation even in the most well-differentiated cancers increases.",

However, there are generally many more transit amplifying cells than stem cells and so some mathematical models predict that most cancers derive from transit amplifying cells, even if that requires additional mutations to disrupt differentiation 132 . In order to become cancerous, transit amplifying cells must avoid the fate of being sloughed from the off of a proliferating tissue (Figure 2b ). Any stem cell that disrupts differentiation and divides symmetrically, producing two daughter stem cells, will have a fitness advantage over other stem cells that divide asymmetrically and use some of their resources to produce non-stem cells (Figure 2a ). In summary, there are good evolutionary reasons to expect that virtually all cancer cells can gain a fitness benefit from disrupting differentiation, which explains why dysregulation of differentiation consistently evolves and is a universal feature of cancers.",

Dysregulated differentiation is present in virtually all cancers yet has not yet been described as a cancer hallmark. Like other hallmarks, dysregulated differentiation involves a breakdown of the cellular cooperation that typically makes multicellularity possible -in this case disrupting the division of labor among the cells of a body. At the time that the original hallmarks of cancer were described, it was not known that dysregulated differentiation was mechanistically distinct from growth inhibition, but now that this is known, it is a further reason to consider dysregulated differentiation a hallmark of cancer. Dysregulated differentiation also has clinical utility, as it forms the basis of pathological grading, predicts clinical outcomes, and is a viable target for therapies aimed at inducing differentiation. Here we argue that hallmarks of cancer should be near universal, mechanistically distinct, and have clinical utility for prognosis and/or therapy.

Dysregulation of differentiation is molecularly distinct from the other hallmarks, including evading growth suppressors, and it has been successfully targeted for therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma. Further, it is clear that dysregulated differentiation is a breakdown of multicellular cooperation, and the only aspect of this breakdown of multicellular cooperation that is not already represented in the hallmarks of cancer 4 . Together, this suggests that dysregulated differentiation is a missing hallmark that should be added to the commonly accepted list of shared phenotypes of cancer.",

We propose the following guidelines for implementing normalization of gene expression involving ionizing radiation across multiple time points and various radiation doses. (i) Careful selection of stable HKGs that show little experimental and Cq variation across multiple time points and various doses including 0 Gy. (ii) Identifying stable HKGs by grouping together all doses including 0 Gy and time points within a cancer cell line or multiple cell lines from the same cancer tissue type and (iii) applying geometric mean to calculate fold changes over arithmetic mean. We have listed the top five ranked stable HKGs identified in commonly used cancer cell lines across IR treatment groups which could be utilized as a resource for normalization of gene expression data. In addition, selection of stable HKGs with independent cellular functions that are unlikely to be co-regulated in radiation studies would be critical for normalization. Furthermore, our data suggest that use of more than one HKG yields a better estimate of normalizing gene expression across IR treatment groups.",

This is especially important when dealing with heterogeneous populations such as cancer cells derived from patient samples. Such efforts will prove valuable for preclinical studies that examine radiation alone, or radiation combined with agents that modulate molecular targets to alter radiation response 26, 27 . To add to this variability, IR can have a significant impact on cellular processes that may influence the outcome of RNA expression. To minimize experimental fluctuations, we selected fourteen HKGs (Supplementary Table S1 ) that have different functional roles in the cell so as to reduce the probability of genes that might be co-regulated. In addition, primers designed for all these genes had a uniform annealing temperature of 61 °C and amplicon size of less than 150 bp which would also reduce the variability introduced due to PCR amplification efficiency. The HKGs selected were amplified in three different cancer cell types -head and neck, non-small lung and pancreas and irradiated 2, 4 and 6 Gy doses. The Cq data obtained from these HKGs were compared statistically using two independent algorithms which quantified the stability of HKGs in post-irradiated samples at different time intervals.",

The Textpresso software [17] [18] [19] has been applied successfully to a number of model organism databases, as well as to other kinds of curated databases. Textpresso uses multiple ontologies to create lists of terms that can be identified in running text. Users can construct their own search using these ontologies. Other tools in active use are ProMiner [20] and RLIMS-P [21] , which extract from articles gene/protein terms and phosphorylation events, respectively. The European Bioinformatics Institute's Whatizit software [22] provides, among other things, a retrieval/search engine for PubMed abstracts, identifying molecular biology terms in a number of categories and linking them to publicly available databases. There are other similar special purpose search tools, such as iHOP [23] or Chilibot [24] that focus on identifying specific types of biological entities (genes, proteins) and their relations. However, none of these solutions addressed the specific needs of the CTD curation workflow.",

These results suggest that biocurator identification of relevant journal articles is efficient; however, more effective identification and ranking of relevant journal articles by a text-mining application would further maximize productivity and increase the quantity of data curated in CTD. We performed inter-biocurator agreement studies to determine how well biocurators agreed when curating an article, to provide an upper bound for performance of text mining. We calculated that precision for curated actors was high (average, 0.91) and recall was lower (average, 0.71). This is consistent with results reported by Camon et al.

Actor identification was very effective (80% of all curated actors identified), particularly when adjusted for actors that seemed to be found only in the abstracts of journal articles from our control data set (92%). Interestingly, text mining and manual curation share many of the same challenges, not the least of which is gene name identification and inconsistency in nomenclature use [15] . Given these challenges, our actor identification results were particularly gratifying.",

Similar results were found in a new test case for indomethacin journal articles, where we demonstrated that the text-mining applications ranked articles with curatable data more highly that those without curatable data. This correlation is a significant finding because it shows that these tools will allow us to cast a wider net when identifying potential journal articles for curation because we will be able to prioritize articles for curation more knowledgeably and maximize the productivity of biocurators by presenting them with a subset of information-rich journal articles that are more likely to contain curatable data (Figure 3 ). Specifically, our rulesbased application will enable us to more effectively identify information-rich articles and thereby capture more data from an equivalent number of articles. Effective actor identification will also enable better assessment of our data coverage for particular chemicals, genes, or diseases and consequently identify data that may be missing or in need of updating in CTD using an approach similar to our indomethacin study. Finally, although we might maximize information retrieval by mining the full text of journal articles rather than just abstracts, our indomethacin results corroborate a recent report indicating that reviewing abstracts as an indexing unit may be comparable to reviewing the full text of articles [27] . Therefore, at least for ranking, attempting to overcome the many additional challenges associated with mining full-text articles may not yield substantially better results than mining abstracts.",

          "text": "We are greatly encouraged by the results of our prototype text-mining applications. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to integrate \"off-the-shelf\" tools to provide significant value to a biocuration workflow. We applied a method based on inter-biocurator agreement of manual annotation to identify where to insert text-mining tools into the curation workflow to maximize pay-off. We were able to assemble quite rapidly a text-mining pipeline by using freely available entity recognition software; we developed two ranking strategies and evaluated their performance. We estimate that the actual tool acquisition and integration took only a few staff weeks; the bulk of the time on the project was spent in creation of a baseline for comparison, and in evaluation of the performance of the two ranking approaches (Lucene and the rule-based approach). While we chose entity recognition systems based on the specific CTD application, we believe that this approach can be extended both to handle other parts of the CTD curation pipeline, and to other curation applications. To further improve our results, we will evaluate the impact of optimizing weighting criteria using multivariate analysis; modifying requirements for retrieving actor terms (e.g., length of words, removal of common confusable English words); and using additional criteria including inclusion of CTD action terms in the search for actors, and extending analysis to the full text of journal articles. We will also look carefully at certain aspects of the EBI's Whatizit software. Although Whatizit employs all of the major recognition tools that we selected for integration into our prototypes, we will specifically evaluate their disease tools in an attempt to mitigate the extended response times we experienced during MetaMap processing.",

Several aspects will need to be explored in more detail in the future to improve gene normalization tools applied to fulltext articles, starting with the actual choice of the databases that should be used as a reference. Here, both SwissProt as well as EntrezGene are certainly valuable resources, especially for well studied genomes, but neither covers all the proteins (and their names or symbols) described in the literature.

The rate of accumulation of \"raw data\" (genome sequences, results of high-throughput experiments) is growing rapidly.

A major function of these databases is to associate the biological building blocks (sequence data, genes, proteins) with results from the published literature via ontologies or controlled vocabularies. This is currently an expensive and slow manual operation. To keep up with this deluge of data, it will be necessary to rely increasingly on automated aids to speed up this process.

While contrastive image-text pairing-based pre-training models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, the transferability to dense tasks remains a challenge for researchers that has yet to be explored. To address this gap, the researchers introduce an innovative method that incorporates CLIP and prompt patterns into dense tasks for the first time, along with a context-aware prompt that can adaptively adjust based on the specific task and input context. The utilization of context-aware prompts enables better capture of the semantic correlation between images and text in dense tasks, transforming the image-text matching problem into a pixel-text matching problem that improves model performance. DenseCLIP leverages large pre-trained models, such as CLIP, to learn the contrastive relationship between images and text, optimizing the model by maximizing the similarity between matched image-text pairs. This transformation and training strategy allows the model to better comprehend the finegrained relationship between images and text in dense tasks. The introduction of DenseCLIP provides an innovative approach to transferring large pre-trained models to dense tasks. This method combines context-aware prompts and pixeltext matching problems, offering valuable insights and techniques for addressing the image-text correlation challenge in dense tasks.",

Automatic prompts represent the downstream task's prompt as a trainable continuous vector, enhancing prompt flexibility and adjustability. This approach allows prompts to be optimized based on specific task characteristics, rather than being limited to fixed manual settings. By training learnable prompt vectors, the CoOP model can automatically learn the appropriate prompt representation for different tasks. This flexibility enables the model to better adapt to diverse data and task requirements. However, the CoOP method exhibits lower generalization performance compared to CLIP on new data, which may be due to overfitting on downstream tasks. To address this issue, the authors introduce a lightweight Meta-Net that leverages the outputs of the image encoder and combines them with the trainable prompt. This results in a dynamic prompt that not only is a self-adaptive continuous vector learned regarding downstream tasks but also incorporates image features as conditions. The introduction of this dynamic prompt has significant implications for achieving better generalization performance.",

To achieve this, the SAM [53] is created. SAM leverages prompt engineering to tackle general downstream segmentation tasks by utilizing the prompt segmentation task as a pre-training objective [97] . To enhance the model's flexibility in adapting to prompts and to improve its robustness against interference, SAM is divided into three components: the image encoder, the prompt encoder, and the mask decoder. This division effectively distributes the computational cost, resulting in a sufficiently adaptable and versatile segmentation model [53] . SAM's strength lies in its ability to generalize efficiently across different segmentation tasks, thanks to the prompt engineering approach [11, 98, 99] . This methodology of pre-training on prompt segmentation and fine-tuning on specific downstream tasks helps SAM leverage the knowledge learned from the prompt segmentation task to improve performance on a wide range of segmentation problems, including medical image analysis [100] [101] [102] [103] , video object tracking [104] [105] [106] [107] , data annotation [108] [109] [110] , 3D reconstruction [111] , robotics [112] [113] [114] , image editing [115, 116] , and more.

          "text": "More than 1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed and more than 600,000 people die from cancer in the US every year. Radiotherapy (RT) is a standard treatment option used for nearly 50% of cancer patients (44) (45) (46) (47) . Physics plays an important role in radiation oncology due to the complexity and sophistication of physics and engineering adopted in modern radiation therapy. Therefore, it is essential for the radiation oncology professionals to understand radiation oncology physics well to ensure the safety and accuracy of the radiation treatment of cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate LLMs on a highly-specialized topic, radiation oncology physics, based on a 100-question multiple choice exam that was specifically designed for this study. The exam can be found in the Appendix, Section A. The scoring results from the non-expert group suggest that the general population knows very little about radiation oncology physics as their scores were similar to random guessing. Bard (LaMDA) slightly outperformed the non-experts while BLOOMZ and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) greatly outperformed the nonexperts. Amazingly, GPT-4 was able to outperform the average medical physicist in nearly all subcategories and improved its answer accuracy when prompted to explain its reasoning before answering (Figures 2A , 5 ). As a general principle for improving accuracy, users should consider prompting ChatGPT to explain first, then answer. ChatGPT (GPT-4) showed a surprising ability to deductively reason in answering all 100 questions where each correct answer was modified to be \"None of the above choices is the correct answer.\", particularly when it was prompted to explain first, then answer, scoring 55% overall. This result is somewhat perplexing and could potentially be an emergent property. Emergent properties are known to occur as the number of parameters is increased in LLMs (43) . This novel method may be a useful method in determining whether deductive reasoning improves with the number of parameters going forward.",

In terms of the latency of activation reported in our previous study (Shigihara and Zeki, 2013) , we found that all three areas were activated within the same time frame of 27-44 ms when subjects viewed lines and rhombuses. This compares with early latencies of 30-50 ms for activation of V1 reported in the monkey (Maunsell and Gibson, 1992) . Although the use of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for these results strongly favored the parallel model over the hierarchical one (see Shigihara and Zeki, 2013) , there still remains the possibility that our results did not detect, for technical reasons, much smaller differences in latency-in the 5-10 ms range, in activation between the three areas. It is therefore possible that an area such as V1 may have been activated by, say, 10 ms before an area such as V3. But in light of the evident overlap in latency of activation between these areas and the activation of V1 at 30-50 ms, we must still consider similar latencies of activation as a strong pointer to the possibility of parallel processing.",

This anatomical arrangement as well as the sequence of latencies in the areas provoked by visual stimulation (Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000 for a review) reinforces support for the hierarchical doctrine of form perception, which supposes that OS cells of V1 are the source of the physiological building blocks of form, from which further, more complex, forms are elaborated. As we point out in the Introduction, there is much to support such a claim. But, in the work reported here, we set out to extend our earlier time-based study using MEG (Shigihara and Zeki, 2013) , to learn whether there is not, in addition, a parallel strategy in the construction of form involving these three areas. The results reported here, taken together with our earlier MEG evidence, lead us to suspect that a parallel strategy, whose source may not be confined to V1, may also be used to elaborate forms, in addition to the well-documented hierarchical strategy.",

Following the idea that the meaning of a word can be determined by 'the company it keeps' (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010) , i.e., the words that it co-occurs with, word embedding projects discrete words to a low-dimensional and continuous vector space where co-occurred words are located close to each other. Compared to conventional discrete representations (e.g., the one-hot encoding), word embedding provides more robust representations for words, particulary for those that infrequently appear in the training data. More importantly, the embedding encodes syntactic and semantic content implicitly, so that relations among words can be simply computed as the distances among their embeddings, or word vectors. A well-known efficient word embedding approach was recently proposed by (Mikolov et al., 2013a) , where two log-linear models (CBOW and skip-gram) are proposed to learn the neighboring relation of words in context. A following work proposed by the same authors introduces some modifications that largely improve the efficiency of model training (Mikolov et al., 2013c ).",

(2016) considered a de-noising autoencoder model (SDAE) where noise is introduced in a sentence by deleting words and swapping bigrams and the decoder is required to reconstruct the original sentence. Bowman et al. (2015) proposed a generative model of sentences based on a variational autoencoder. Kenter et al. (2016) learn bag-of-words (BoW) representations of sentences by considering a conceptually similar task of identifying context sentences from candidates and evaluate their representations on sentence similarity tasks. Hill et al. (2016) introduced the FastSent model which uses a BoW representation of the input sentence and predicts the words appearing in context (and optionally, the source) sentences. The model is trained to predict whether a word appears in the target sentences. Arora et al. ( 2016 ) consider a weighted BoW model followed by simple post-processing and show that it performs better than BoW models trained on paraphrase data. Jernite et al. (2017) use paragraph level coherence as a learning signal to learn representations. The following related task is considered in their work. Given the first three sentences of a paragraph, choose the next sentence from five sentences later in the paragraph. Related to our objective is the local coherence model of Li & Hovy (2014) where a binary classifier is trained to identify coherent/incoherent sentence windows. In contrast, we only encourage observed contexts to be more plausible than contrastive ones and formulate it as a multi-class classification problem. We experimentally found that this relaxed constraint helps learn better representations.",

This ties VSMs to some form of distributional hypothesis (see Sections 1.1 and 2.7); therefore the limits of VSMs depend on the limits of the family of distributional hypotheses. Are statistical patterns of word usage sufficient to figure out what people mean? This is arguably the major open question of VSMs, and the answer will determine the future of VSMs. We do not have a strong argument one way or the other, but we believe that the continuing progress with VSMs suggests we are far from reaching their limits.",

Most of the criticism stems from the fact that term-document and word-context matrices typically ignore word order. In LSA, for instance, a phrase is commonly represented by the sum of the vectors for the individual words in the phrase; hence the phrases house boat and boat house will be represented by the same vector, although they have different meanings. In English, word order expresses relational information. Both house boat and boat house have a Tool-Purpose relation, but house boat means Tool-Purpose(boat, house) (a boat that serves as a house), whereas boat house means Tool-Purpose(house, boat) (a house for sheltering and storing boats). Landauer (2002) estimates that 80% of the meaning of English text comes from word choice and the remaining 20% comes from word order. However, VSMs are not inherently limited to 80% of the meaning of text. Mitchell and Lapata (2008) propose composition models sensitive to word order. For example, to make a simple additive model become syntax-aware, they allow for different weightings of the contributions of the vector components. Constituents that are more important to the composition therefore can participate more actively. Clark and Pulman (2007) assigned distributional meaning to sentences using the Hilbert space tensor product. Widdows and Ferraro (2008) , inspired by quantum mechanics, explores several operators for modeling composition of meaning. Pair-pattern matrices are sensitive to the order of the words in a pair (Turney, 2006) . Thus there are several ways to handle word order in VSMs.",

In this work, we employed the Rouge-1 score, a conventional metric for calculating text similarity, as the criterion for evaluating the results. We also compared the evaluation criteria using Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L scores and finally found that the performance is sensitive to the set threshold and achieved optimal results using the Rouge-1 score. We speculate that the differences caused by the scores used is due to the fact that the expression of words or phrases in a specific domain differs greatly from the general-domain text used for training the LLMs. Thus, using fine-grained evaluation metrics (i.e., Rouge-1) is better for evaluating the details of the generated results. We also envision that better evaluation criteria that can capture higher-level semantic information from the text will be highly needed with the advancement of LLMs.",

The idea of hard negative mining (HNM) (Girshick et al., 2013) has gained much attention recently. Pang et al. (2019) proposed a novel method called IoU-balanced sampling and Chen et al. (2019) designed a ranking model to replace the conventional classification task with an average-precision loss to alleviate the class imbalance issue. The efforts made on object detection have greatly inspired us to solve the data imbalance issue in NLP. Sudre et al. (2017) addressed the severe class imbalance issue for the image segmentation task. They proposed to use the class re-balancing property of the Generalized Dice Loss as the training objective for unbalanced tasks. Shen et al. (2018) investigated the influence of Dice-based loss for multi-class organ segmentation using a dataset of abdominal CT volumes. Kodym et al. (2018) proposed to use the batch soft Dice loss function to train the CNN network for the task of segmentation of organs at risk (OAR) of medical images. Shamir et al. (2019) extended the definition of the classical Dice coefficient to facilitate the direct comparison of a ground truth binary image with a probabilistic map. In this paper, we introduce dice loss into NLP tasks as the training objective and propose a dynamic weight adjusting strategy to address the dominating influence of easy-negative examples.",

This is intrinsically because dice loss is actually a soft version of the F1 score. Taking the binary classification task as an example, at test time, an example will be classified as negative as long as its probability is smaller than 0.5, but training will push the value to 0 as much as possible. This gap isn't a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easynegative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones. Inspired by the idea of focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) in computer vision, we propose a dynamic weight adjusting strategy, which associates each training example with a weight in proportion to (1 -p), and this weight dynamically changes as training proceeds. This strategy helps deemphasize confident examples during training as their probability p approaches 1, making the model attentive to hard-negative examples, and thus alleviates the dominating effect of easy-negative exam-ples. Combing both strategies, we observe significant performance boosts on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks.",

Since there is a low turnout of participants who frequently use these tools in teaching or engage students with it during translation teaching activities, there is a possibility of the presence of barriers that instigate this challenge. These factors are listed as age-related issue, ethical issue, and inadequate training. In terms of age-related issue, older/senior professors may have had a little experience to digital technologies as compared to newer generations. Some individuals may possess little familiarity with digital equipment and software, including artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Moreover, previous studies in the domain of technology adoption have shown that persons of advanced age may have a higher propensity for resistance towards change. Certain senior educators may have lacked the chance to use technology into their pedagogical approaches throughout their professional trajectories, Mays et al. (2021) . Ethical issues include privacy of data and stereotype. Gibbs (2022) claimed that the usage of AI technology raises concerns that some duties within the educational system may become less valuable or employment may be lost.",

As a result, translation educators are now required to regularly refresh their knowledge and skills to keep up with the latest advancements in AI translation technologies. Within the framework of this ever-evolving pedagogical environment, educators specializing in translation, particularly those of advanced age may have challenges while adapting to the evolving demands of instructional approaches and educational procedures. In the light of this identified challenge, the current research explored the opinions of some selected translation lecturers to share their views on how AI can be utilized to support older/senior lecturers and aid them to adapt to the changing landscape of the domain of translation pedagogy. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) this study highlighted that AI tools enhances adaptability to dynamic nature of translation pedagogy by older lectures. In addition to the identified solution to the factors limiting effective integration of these tools, there is need for Continuous professional development (CPD) for older/senior lecturers to assure their proficiency in the newest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI)technology and pedagogical approaches.",

Following the same theme, the collection edited by Bassnett and Lefevere (1990) Translation, history and culture, gives credence to the notion that translation was noticeably approached from the cultural perspective. It is argued that the translation produced for a particular audience, i.e. the target text per se is deemed a fact pertaining to a single language, a single textual tradition, and therefore it is related to the target culture (Toury, 1980, 82-83; Tymoczko, 2010, 216) . Hence, translators are regarded as 'persons-in-the-culture' of the TL system (Toury, 1995, 40; Tymoczko, 2010, 216) . Though this argument can be challenged, it remains an important claim arising from the evolution of translation studies (Tymoczko, 2010, 216) .",

          "text": "In his essay, Simms (1983) explains how the position of the translator intersects with the translation politics. He goes on to confirm the aforementioned proposition in both cases whether the translator belongs to the postcolonial culture, supporting the imperial language through translating into this language and its culture, or whether he/she takes one of the potential positions in which translation takes place targeting members of the TL culture in a particular system. Theoretical claims and descriptive studies carried out by a number of scholars, including Simms, show that the place of the translator can be taken within the TL culture, SL culture or in a different culture, as in the case when German philologists rendered some literature written originally in Irish into English, then published it in series written in German (Tymoczko, 2010, 217) . The translator's ideological position and temporal position are both deemed pivotal issues related to the evolution of translation studies. This indeed has led to the notion of viewing translation as a space or place separated from the real and cultural position held by the translator, and different from the translator's ideological position too (Tymoczko, 2010, 217) . Researched and utilized as a fruitful subject tackled by writers engaged in translation theory and practice, translation has been viewed as a space located between different spaces (Tymoczko, 2010, 217) . Within the same line of thought, Simon (1996, 162) views translation as 'the blurred edge' in which the source text and the target text may meet. This space is difficult to the extent that no writer can hold it. She then sees the domain of translation as the reach of a person with multicultural backgrounds; it is the hybrid place which exists between the realities of different national cultures, though has no role to play in affecting any of them (Simon, 1996, 153) . Indeed, Simon (1996) follows in her methodology Spivak (1992) , the work of whom has been regarded as one of the most momentous exploration within the notion of translation ideology. Spivak (1992, 178) views translation as a kind of activity in which meaning moves from one place to another and stabilizes in a particular space between the source and target languages. This is given credence by Mehrez (1992, 121) , within the translation and postcolonial context, who claims that texts produced by postcolonial bilingual writers create a language, which is characterized by being placed in a specific space 'in between', i.e. between the source and target languages. Tymoczko (2010, 219) explains the main reason behind viewing translation as a space between two languages, claiming that due to the physical positioning of the translator as being a speaker located between two different communities, it has become logical to consider translation a space between two different languages. However, from the perspective of translation ideology, the notion of considering translation a space 'in between' is deemed problematic as it leads to misconception of the nature of engagement itself, though translation demands collaboration and affiliation (Tymoczko, 2010, 226) .",

These factors include the nature of the text he/she is required to translate, the purpose of the translation or what Icoz (2012, 132) calls 'the aim of the translation' and the type of audience to whom the translation is directed. The translator needs to build his/her strategic decisions upon the aforementioned factors, treating each factor on its own merit. Such strategic decisions should be justifiable as any person might question them (Baker & Maier, 2011) . However, if confronted with a severely offensive texts; having to translate some lines that contain noticeable insults or negative statements against specific religions or particular prophets, which are totally repugnant to the translator's personal ethics, the translator may withdraw from the situation, as stated by Phelan (2001) above.",

Taken on board the broad sense of translation ethics, there is a clear connection between translation norms and translation ethics, which may well appear in the positive reaction of the translator to a particular translation situation and the act of building trust among all the parties participating in the translation process/transaction. However, translation norms can at times oppose translation ethics, if what is meant by ethics is to follow the source text verbatim, the main theme of the present paper.",

Humboldt, for instance, insists on the need for keeping the foreign elements found in the original text intact in the target text. Schleiermacher calls the translator to enable the target reader to hear the voice of the original writer, rather than the voices of any other party. Berman's method for preserving translation ethics is to advocate literal translation in order to respect the source text's form and content. Within the English speaking world, Venuti supports Berman's views of ethics, discussing ethics of difference, but adding an ideological and political element thereto (Hermans, 2009, 97-98) . Badiou (2001) , in his interpretation of truth-based ethics, argues that truth has nothing to do with adequacy to reality or enlightenment. It is, however, a process of investigation, which deals with an event that presents something different from the current situation, which is identified by \"opinions and instituted knowledges\" (p. 67). The event is meant to locate and support the lack in the current situation. This gives rise to the creation of a subject whose task is to maintain a break with it through investigating the results of the event, form, the ramifications of the concept along with the practice which possesses such merit so as to be called truth (Venuti, 2013, 184) .",

Therefore, if their professional ethics are contrary to their own personal ethics to the point that it becomes difficult to feel this kind of pride, they may make momentous decisions with regard to the place and conditions under which they accept to work. Taking this on board, translators are beginning to strike a balance between their own personal ethics and their professional ethics as professional translators (Robinson, 2003, 26) . They are required to make particular choices as they can never relay all features of the source text into the receptor language. Thus, their choices would determine their position of enunciation. This gives rise to the notion of establishing priorities in translation (Tymoczko, 2006, 453) as translation loss will inevitably take place in any translation work. The choices made by translators should clearly determine the ST elements that must be rendered into the TL, and those which should be dispensed with, hence translation may arguably be viewed as a metonymic process (Tymoczko, 2006, 453) .",

At one end of the spectrum, there are scholars who believe in following the source text literally regardless of whether or not the target text sounds exotic to the target reader, thus conveying the form and content of the source text into the target language. At the other end of the spectrum, there are other scholars who argue over the merit of producing a target text that lives up to the expectations of the target reader, fits the cultural setting of the target language and fulfils its appropriate function, thus making substantial changes on the source text form and probably the content too. The present paper would argue for a middle place between the two; following translation ethics by reproducing the form and content of the source text as much as possible and, at the same time, producing a target text which is comprehensible by the target reader and can fulfil its function. Special emphasis should be placed on the text type, the purpose of the translation and the type of audience. Finally, if the translator fails to strike the right balance between respecting translation ethics and producing a translation that can serve its purpose, or if he/she is faced with a largely offensive text, the translator may withdraw from the situation.",

I believe they correctly identify the intellectual framing and mindset necessary to understand how the authors of the Parrot Paper came to write it. The presuppositions listed below justify the opinions and beliefs expressed in the Parrot Paper. 1. Ethics and fairness are to be assessed from a Rawlsian [18] perspective. Actions that may result in benefits to those who are not the least well off (or otherwise describable as being the \"most marginal\") are to be avoided. Only actions that also provide benefits to the most marginal are deemed ethical and fair. [PP lines 94-98, 327, 389-407, 1021-22] 2. Judgments regarding presupposition #1 are to be made based upon first-order effects (the direct result of actions). Making use of second (indirect consequences and entailments) and higher-order effects in argumentation is \"suspect.\" [PP lines 95-97, 322-350] 3. Greater deployment potential for tools means a larger sphere of influence for the model on which the tools depend [PP line 266, Section 4.1] 4. Environmental costs and impacts cannot ever be offset and are meaningful first-order effects that must always be minimized. [PP Lines 94-100, Section 3] 5. Systemic racism must be recognized as present in all systems examined and is required to be addressed by any actions taken. [PP lines 385-386, 427-428] 6. Microaggressions and the possibility of encountering upsetting or derogatory language is a significant harm that must either not be allowed to occur or which must be offset. [PP lines 771-789, 813-827] 7. Resources need to be allocated equitably (with no definition given of what counts as equitable or who gets to determine judgments of equality). [PP lines 42-428, 883-887] 8. The dominance of English is a problem (even in an English language setting). [PP lines 18, 327-333, 384, 766-770] 9. Language use, in general, reflects White supremacist, misogynistic, and ageist views. These views must be countered or eliminated. [PP lines 385-386, 822-827] 10. Black-box methods (where only the input and the output are observable while the \"how\" is unexplained) are, by definition, inferior to articulatable methodologies under ALL circumstances.",

[PP lines 233-244] But the Parrot Paper fails to discuss how often and under what circumstances these costs are incurred and what benefits result from each such run of the models. Without both benefits and costs disclosed, a reader has no basis for making any evaluation regarding trade-offs. Instead, the Parrot Paper authors rely on the presupposition that any incurrence of cost is bad. The Parrot Paper is also devoid of any discussion of efforts to improve the efficiency of the models employed, the chips on which they run, and the machines themselves -all of which will reduce environmental impacts. Huge environmental improvements are forecast for the near future, but that \"fact\" is missing from the Parrot Paper's discussion of environmental issues. [19] The hidden complaint in the Parrot Paper is that the \"real world\" contains both ambiguity and \"bad language.\" [PP lines 802-809] The authors of the Parrot Paper believe the world would be better off if the ambiguity could be eliminated (or at least mitigated) and the same with the use of \"bad language.\" Large language models succeed in statistically capturing and then replaying (\"parroting\") both the bad language and the ambiguity. By contrast, a smaller, more ordered, and curated set of models could eliminate the \"bad\" form of the language and inherent ambiguities in language use. [PP lines 994-999]",

To the cybernetician, it is the very ability of an actor to question interpretations and to make choices (what seldom willing to ascribe confidence in such an assertion. They will either accept the model as \"reality\" or reject the very science which produced it.

It is the role of science and of scientific researchers to then ask what happens should the values assumed for those presuppositions change.

Therefore, they claim their decision was not based on reflection who else is involved, how and who the alternative options will affect and reasoning and choosing the best alternative, but rather on intuition. however, when we speak about an expert, we speak about someone with years of experience in his professional field, which means that his past decisions, contemplating on good and bad consequences of decisions made and thinking about alternative options, will serve as the basis of ever faster, decreasingly risky decision-making or, as dreyfus (1992) states that \"with talent and a great deal of involved experience the beginner develops into an expert who sees intuitively what to do without applying rules and making judgements at all\". such intuitive decision-making of experts is mostly correct, even if it was quick and frugal. however, we must not forget, it is a consequence of years long effort, an enormous amount of time invested in reflecting about decisions and possibly lingering presence of remorse if decision was not the best. 2  the second method is to appeal to authority. by doing this, moral responsibility for the consequences of our actions is at least partly taken from our shoulders. listeners could decide that euthanasia is morally unacceptable and justify their decision by stating that this is what their professor said or that it is written in the law or in the ethical code. 3 if we appealed to one of the above mentioned possibilities, we could get to know the problems of appealing to authority. 4 these are: (i) we can easily commit a fallacy. What we mean by that is that the code of ethics or the person we are appealing to, is not an expert in the field we are referring to or that the code of ethics does not apply to the referred field. If, for example, we appeal to an astronomer when discussing euthanasia, we are talking about a fallacy or fallacious justification. (ii) uncritically accepting an expert or a code of ethics means that we are excluding the possibility of them being mistaken, which can be a mistake on our part. for science this would mean non-progress, since, if we believed the authorities proving that the earth is flat and we can fall from its edges, we would not have seafarers who wanted to explore and would not have the contemporary theory claiming that the earth is an ever changing oblate spheroid, a theory again rejected by some. 5 (iii) experts or articles of an ethical code of optional professional ethics can be, referring to a concrete example, unclear in answering what to do or even contradictory. even if codes comprise rules, the interpretation is necessary. besides, they cannot cover each situation and cannot give unambiguous answer for each situation. for example, in 8 th bullet point of 5 th principle of the code of ethics for nurses and health technicians it is written: \"a nurse does not perform procedures for which she does not have the adequate competences and experience\" (2005) and in 7 th that she must not deny medical assistance suitable for her professional qualification. In case she should perform X according to her professional qualification but lacks experience, which standard should be more important? therefore, if the agent relentlessly sticks to the ethical code, he might be confronted with \"a decision that falls outside of the code of ethics for their profession\", which means he \"will be ill-equipped with allegiance to moral relativism, likely not possessing the necessary tools to make a reasoned, defensible decision. it is troubling to think of a future professional, especially one who is faced with a life and death decision, adopting a relativist stance towards their professional ethical decisions\" (Jones, 2009, p. 46) .",

Williams is convinced that \"morality is a special system, a particular variety of ethical thought\" /…/ \"it embraces a range of ethical outlooks...\" (Williams, 2007, p. 45) For him the term 'morality' refers to Kant's definition of ethics connected to the concept of duty. ethics on the other side is a much broader concept as it is comprised of elements, e.g. the discussion about the difference between secular and religious morality, not found in morality (Williams, 2007) . a third way of understanding ethics can be found in mcdowell's text, namely, as \"a branch of philosophy related to moral theory\".

          "text": "Basic ethical questions, dilemmas and especially decisions do not only affect the life of an individual but can also affect lives of others. In some professional ethics, where decisions about a person's life or death are made, decisions can even be irreversible. In this contribution three ways of deciding by highlighting critical, and reflective decision-making or systematic thought process as the most effective method in ethics have been pointed out. Therefore, taking ethics as a critically reflective morality highlights the fact that we can talk about ethical exploration, so ethics is a process of thinking, not a set of established answers that need only to be passively accepted. It could be concluded that the study of, and practice in, evaluating arguments and evidence (moral decision making) via critical thinking as well as using other important skills (raising questions according to Blooms taxonomy and doing a lot of case studies) is the best way to achieve the most fundamental goal in teaching an ethical course -becoming a better person. And is therefore something that should be in every curriculum.",

      "method": "Integrating ethics and critical thinking into the educational curriculum using critical, reflective decision-making processes that encourage ethical exploration and understanding, rather than passive acceptance of established answers.\n\n**Explanation:** The integration of ethics and critical thinking into curricula addresses the gap by equipping students with essential skills like evaluating arguments and evidence, raising pertinent questions, and practicing through case studies. This approach encourages students to engage in critical, reflective morality, which is necessary for deep moral understanding and ethical decision-making. It moves away from intuitive and authority-based decision-making methods, promoting systematic thought processes that are more robust and sustainable for long-term ethical reasoning.",
      "limitation": "**从论文章节提取的局限性:**\n\n- Our method may not effectively develop the skill of intuitive understanding in students, as it primarily focuses on analytical and deliberative decision-making up to the proficient level without adequately addressing the transition to expert-level intuition.\n- The approach might struggle in helping students move past the competent level since it provides limited guidance on cultivating holistic perception and situational awareness necessary for becoming proficient and eventually an expert.",
      "future_work": "- Exploring and integrating systematic ethical judging into current educational frameworks could enhance critical thinking capabilities among students, as mentioned in the article's plan to elaborate on this method in future discussions.\n- Developing methodologies to engage students in ethically charged debates, such as the seminar task involving euthanasia, might refine their ability to justify decisions with self-reflection and rationale.\n- Investigating the application of ethics in diverse disciplinary contexts (e.g., medicine, economy, law) can foster a holistic understanding of ethical issues, thereby preparing students for real-world moral dilemmas.\n- Addressing potential contradictions and gaps in ethical codes and expert opinions could improve decision-making strategies that account for ambiguous or unanticipated professional scenarios."

The success of prompts in zero-and few-shot learning has been attributed to the prompts serving as instructions that allow the PLM to learn with fewer examples, much the way humans would (Mishra et al., 2021; Schick and Schütze, 2021a; Brown et al., 2020) . In fact, the excellent results may instead be attributable to the mere exploitation of patterns in the training data of PLMs, and not to PLMs' perceived ability to interpret and follow meaningful instructions. Webson and Pavlick (2021) show, for instance, that irrelevant templates match the performance of meaningful ones in few-shot entailment experiments, adding that some of the templates discovered by automatic generation of discrete prompts are also unnatural (Shin et al., 2020) . In this sense, the results of continuous prompts also show that PLMs do not need meaningful instructions for improving few-shot performance.",

          "text": "In the vast landscape of AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out as rapidly growing, prominent features-akin to towering trees in a dense forest. The datasets that feed their growth and development can be compared to the vital root system of these trees, providing the sustenance that is essential for their performance. Regrettably, the current landscape of LLM-related datasets is extensive, with a lack of cohesive synthesis across the various types of datasets. Understanding the current state and future trends of the LLM datasets presents a formidable challenge. Therefore, this survey offers a comprehensive analysis of LLMs datasets, categorizing and summarizing datasets associated with LLMs across five dimensions: pre-training corpora, fine-tuning instruction datasets, preference datasets, evaluation datasets, and traditional NLP datasets. Alongside this categorization, we identify the current challenges and outline potential directions for future dataset development in four key areas: pretraining, fine-tuning instruction, reinforcement learning, and model evaluation. It is our hope that this survey will serve as a valuable point of reference for researchers both in academia and industry, as well as newcomers and proficient practitioners engaged with LLMs. Our ultimate objective is to continually refine LLMs datasets, to foster a robust and standardized dataset ecosystem, as well as to support the progressive advancement of LLMs.",

      "future_work": "- Investigate improved methods for enhancing sentence and visual embedding techniques to increase alignment accuracy between books and their movie adaptations. This could involve exploring new neural network architectures or training paradigms to better capture the nuances of storytelling in both mediums.\n- Develop a more comprehensive dataset encompassing a broader range of book and movie genres to facilitate the generalization of alignment methods. This would help ensure that the proposed models are robust and applicable across diverse narrative styles and themes.\n- Explore the integration of additional contextual information, like audio cues and emotional tone, into the alignment model to augment the understanding of the narrative's progression and provide richer, story-like visual explanations.\n- Address current limitations in the model's ability to handle highly metaphorical or abstract text by incorporating techniques from natural language processing that are focused on semantic understanding and interpretation of figurative language."

          "text": "With implicit and explicit bias toward them in medical and clinical settings, LGBT patients feel reluctant to come out to their medical providers for fear of discrimination and judgment given that these biases seem to be ignored, if not reinforced, in medical education and clinical training, which can negatively affect the quality of care received by LGBT patients. Historically, this may be because biomedicine has produced highly advanced knowledge of the biological impacts of lived environments with relatively undertheorized analyses of the environments themselves and their social and cultural impacts on medical decisions and patient care (Metzl and Hansen 2014, 129 ). Yet it is also historical to point out, as I have been arguing in this article, that healthcare systems and individual practitioners and researchers have systematically pathologized homosexuality and gender nonconformity, the latter most recently in children. As a result, LGBTQI patients have often undergone reparative conversion therapies, which have now been deemed inappropriate and harmful, and children born with DSD, or disorders in sex development, have been subjected to invasive and damaging interventions, including hormonal treatments and genital cosmetic surgery. More generally, and even without specific Bcorrective^treatments, the lingering, and still all-too-present actual, internalized, and anticipated medical and social stigmas experienced by LGBTQI people often result in risky behaviors amongst those in this vulnerable group that create significant disparities in their physical and mental health (Eckstrand and Sciolla 2014, 12, 14) . It is important to note that the annual report of the United Nations Human Rights Council, published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and entitled BDiscrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity,^stipulates quite clearly that conversion therapy and gender reassignment, when forced or involuntary, as well as unnecessary medical interventions involving intersex children, break the UN's prohibition on torture (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 2015, 11). Moreover, as I have been arguing, the Report also stipulates that discriminatory policies and practices of healthcare institutions adversely affect the quality of health services and deter patients from seeking them (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 2015, 14). This implies radical analyses of new kinds of interventions, contestations, and struggles around the conflation of good health with conformity to gender and sexual norms, as well as further analysis into the contradictions between the urgency of ethical biomedical practice and critical healing alongside the various discourses, ideologies, and cultures which shape biomedicine, and by which biomedical knowledge and clinical practices are themselves shaped.",

          "text": "The current DSM-V replaces the diagnostic category GIDC with BGender Dysphoria^with a separate section dedicated to children, signifying the further displacement of the diagnostic category rather than its disappearance. It describes gender dysphoria as a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and one's assigned gender, the latter of which is based on, and conflated with, natal sex. The diagnostic criteria include a child's strong preference for the clothing of the other gender; a strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe or fantasy play and for the toys, games, and pastimes more typical for the other gender; and the attendant stress that accompanies such incongruence (APA 2013). While the DSM now stipulates that the term Bgender dysphoria^is more descriptive than the previous usage of Bgender identity disorder^as it related to children in the previous editions (APA 2013), the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in children, and the attendant descriptors, seem remarkably similar to those for GIDC, and still echo, to some degree, earlier work on the etiology of homosexuality with regard to its tropes in describing gender variance in children. 4  What the diagnostic history of homosexuality, GIDC, and gender dysphoria in children point to is to the ways in which biomedical knowledge is structured around the polarity of the normal and the pathological to the extent that all have served to maintain heteronormative gender norms. This discursive formation supports Judith Butler's claim that sexuality in culture Bis regulated through the policing and the shaming of gender^ (1993, 238) while providing a powerful and legitimate discursive and clinical apparatus for that very shaming and policing and its medical and social reinforcement. Moreover, these instantiations of homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny in the clinical literature, past and ongoing, have not only been condoned biomedically and clinically but continue to provoke social condemnation, discrimination, the incitement to violence, and the bullying of children who cross-gender identify, with higher rates of suicide among them, in addition to various form of social exclusion, actual or imagined, against gender nonconforming children and gender and sexual dissidents more broadly, while continuing to undermine erotic autonomy and gender expression as fundamental human rights. In addition, mothers have been pathologized in clinical literature as overprotective, indulgent, seductive, overanxious, or unhappily married, and not the slightest consideration has been given to the possibility for mother's and son's subjectivities affording greater closeness and empathy (Corbett 1999, 129) . Moreover, to what extent will a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria in a child be related to a fear of possible gay outcome by therapists, medical professionals, and parents? As I have written previously, what also needs to be pointed out is that transgender identification in children points to the failure of the matrix of heterosexuality to legislate itself fully. In these post-theoretical, post-queer times, how can the trans rupture in the matrix of gender intelligibility be welcomed as producing new identificatory sites and new conceptual apparatuses for understanding the psychological growth of children who cross-gender identify (who may or may not turn out to be gay) and LGBTQ people (who may or may not conform to prescribed gender norms) (Spurlin 1998, 91) ?",

This was tied to deep-seated historical anxieties about discursive appropriations of African sexuality by the West in decadent terms, a legacy of colonialism which remains, as with the term BAfrican AIDS,^in discourses surrounding the global surveillance and tracking of HIV/AIDS. At the same time, the reading of homosexuality as un-African by some strands of African cultural nationalism produced a significant gap for those at risk for HIV who escaped the categories of the West, given that some indigenous African men practiced anal sex with other men but did not identify as gay and lived heterosexual lives publicly, which was compounded by the fact that the WHO saw HIV transmission in Africa largely in heterosexual terms in the early days of the pandemic. AIDS educators were not initially sensitive to the fact that anal sex has different meanings and values in different cultural systems that needed to be addressed in helping those men, who engaged in the practice of anal sex with other men as partners, recognize that safer sex applied to them as well, even if they resisted taking on a gay identity as it is understood in the West. The adoption of the descriptive phrase Bmen who have sex with men,^or MSM, by the WHO's Global Programme on AIDS provided a thinly veiled screen, or closet, at the time, not of mere secrecy but of a Bsafe^identity that was more legibly heterosexual but later, it was realized, no less at risk for HIV transmission or infection. The problem with western understandings of homosexuality, initially imposed by global health organizations on indigenous men who have sex with men, was not so much the conflation of anal sex with homosexuality but the conflation of sexual practice with sexual identity, which places Foucault's proposition of a shift in homosexuality in the nineteenth century from a temporary aberration to an emergent identic category (1980, (42) (43) even more firmly in the West. More important, such imperialist thinking missed significant forms of HIV transmission not immediately apparent to western thinking, which was based on the confluence of sexual practice with sexual identity and resulted in subsequent gaps and delays in education and prevention programs in large parts of sub-Sahara Africa early in the pandemic.",

          "text": "In considering an important historical precedent, biomedical discourses on sexuality were closely linked to the racial politics of National Socialism, whereby Nazi doctors studied homosexuality as a form of social degeneracy and as a threat to racial hygiene, appealing to the authority of biomedical science in order to maintain rigid social distinctions between the genders and the procreative responsibility of Aryan citizens. In the mid-1930s, medical doctors in Germany argued nearly unanimously that homosexuality, medically speaking, was a threat to public health; Germany's leading public health journal at the time Der Öffentliche Gesundheitsdienst described homosexuality as a psychopathology (Proctor 1988, 212 ), 5 not that far removed from clinical descriptions of homosexuality in the DSM-I nearly twenty years later. Arguing against homosexuality as biologically determined, one Nazi doctor, in writing for the Reich Office of Racial Policy in 1938, proclaimed that homosexuals, like Jews, were state criminals and Bnot 'poor, sick' people to be treated, but enemies of the state to be eliminated^ (Proctor 1988, 213) . 6 Going back further, Mosse and others have noted that late nineteenth-century medical literature in Europe, very much influenced by scientific racism at the time, often conflated the pathologies of male Jews and homosexuals-both were thought to be prone to hysteria, nervous bodily distortions, and feminine tone of voice and bodily movements (1999, 64). 7  The biomedicalization of homosexuality under National Socialism was by no means a momentary aberration as nationalist discourses in much of the postcolonial world today read homosexuality as a colonial import and as a form of western decadence that is foreign to indigenous cultural traditions. Western biomedicine has played a role historically as a tool of imperial power. Frantz Fanon, an early postcolonial theorist originally from Martinique who studied medicine and psychiatry in France, and served a medical residency in Algeria and became involved in Algeria's struggle for independence, noted that medical knowledge was one of the most insidious tools of colonial conquest and contributed to the dehumanizing logic of colonial rule (1963, 296) . Similarly speaking of the French colonial conquest of Algeria, Richard Keller notes in Colonial Madness that physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists saw diagnosis and treatment as a contest over civilization alongside health and disease (2007, 11) . In terms of sexuality, this meant that European physicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries read Africa in particular as Ba space of savage violence and lurid sexuality( 1). Largely as a result of the effects of the so-called civilizing mission of colonialism, and the remnants of homophobic laws that often have their origins in colonial administration, HIV/ AIDS sufferers in many postcolonial societies today bear the stigma of sexual deviance and moral laxity, and these markings have been shaped by a history of imperialism, outdated western psychiatric opinion on the etiology of homosexuality, and causal links between homosexuality and HIV/AIDS constructed by western biomedicine in the early history of the pandemic. Yet the effects of the biomedical justification of colonial rule continue in the contemporary surveillance and tracking of HIV/AIDS by global health institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS. As Cindy Patton has argued, the term BAfrican AIDS,^used early in the pandemic, mobilized racist ideologies of unchecked, unbridled sexuality amongst indigenous Africans and amongst blacks in general. 8 The rhetorical strategies of medical thought-styles in representations of HIV/AIDS globally, Patton notes, have been deeply layered with social ideologies around race, class, and sexuality, and have the power Bto structure the terms through which bodies become visible as the locations of disease, of an epidemic^ (2002, 26) .",

South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, estimated by the South African government's statistical report of 2015 to be at about 6.19 million of its total population of 54.96 million with the highest impact of HIV/AIDS falling on indigenous African women (Statistics South Africa 2015) . A report on violence against women and HIV/AIDS by the UNAIDS Coalition on Women and AIDS and the WHO points to the everyday realities of gender inequality and intimate partner violence in South Africa. It is difficult for women, particularly younger women, to negotiate condom use with intimate male partners. High rates of gender-based violence and rape often serve as barriers to women seeking HIV testing, anti-retroviral treatment, and access to services which could prevent mother to child transmission (UNAIDS Global Coalition on Women and AIDS and WHO 2005) . Alarming numbers of indigenous African women who identify as lesbian experience Bcorrective rape^as a cure for their so-called aberrant desires, placing them at risk for HIV/AIDS as well.",

          "text": "The current DSM-V replaces the diagnostic category GIDC with BGender Dysphoria^with a separate section dedicated to children, signifying the further displacement of the diagnostic category rather than its disappearance. It describes gender dysphoria as a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and one's assigned gender, the latter of which is based on, and conflated with, natal sex. The diagnostic criteria include a child's strong preference for the clothing of the other gender; a strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe or fantasy play and for the toys, games, and pastimes more typical for the other gender; and the attendant stress that accompanies such incongruence (APA 2013). While the DSM now stipulates that the term Bgender dysphoria^is more descriptive than the previous usage of Bgender identity disorder^as it related to children in the previous editions (APA 2013), the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in children, and the attendant descriptors, seem remarkably similar to those for GIDC, and still echo, to some degree, earlier work on the etiology of homosexuality with regard to its tropes in describing gender variance in children. 4  What the diagnostic history of homosexuality, GIDC, and gender dysphoria in children point to is to the ways in which biomedical knowledge is structured around the polarity of the normal and the pathological to the extent that all have served to maintain heteronormative gender norms. This discursive formation supports Judith Butler's claim that sexuality in culture Bis regulated through the policing and the shaming of gender^ (1993, 238) while providing a powerful and legitimate discursive and clinical apparatus for that very shaming and policing and its medical and social reinforcement. Moreover, these instantiations of homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny in the clinical literature, past and ongoing, have not only been condoned biomedically and clinically but continue to provoke social condemnation, discrimination, the incitement to violence, and the bullying of children who cross-gender identify, with higher rates of suicide among them, in addition to various form of social exclusion, actual or imagined, against gender nonconforming children and gender and sexual dissidents more broadly, while continuing to undermine erotic autonomy and gender expression as fundamental human rights. In addition, mothers have been pathologized in clinical literature as overprotective, indulgent, seductive, overanxious, or unhappily married, and not the slightest consideration has been given to the possibility for mother's and son's subjectivities affording greater closeness and empathy (Corbett 1999, 129) . Moreover, to what extent will a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria in a child be related to a fear of possible gay outcome by therapists, medical professionals, and parents? As I have written previously, what also needs to be pointed out is that transgender identification in children points to the failure of the matrix of heterosexuality to legislate itself fully. In these post-theoretical, post-queer times, how can the trans rupture in the matrix of gender intelligibility be welcomed as producing new identificatory sites and new conceptual apparatuses for understanding the psychological growth of children who cross-gender identify (who may or may not turn out to be gay) and LGBTQ people (who may or may not conform to prescribed gender norms) (Spurlin 1998, 91) ?",

          "text": "Yet, while it appears as if their analysis is demonstrating the ways in which cultural politics construct the clinical situation and the dynamics of patient care, Metzl and his colleagues fail to account for clinical attitudes toward sexuality as a significant vector of influence. In theorizing medical engagement with stigma and inequality in an article on structural competency in medical education, published in Social Sciences and Medicine, also in 2014, Metzl and Hansen argue that medical education needs to train health care professionals more systematically so that they can think about how such variables as race, social class, gender, and ethnicity shape and are shaped by the interactions between doctors and patients (Metzl and Hansen 2014, 127) . It is no wonder that the development of structural competency in medical education seems to occlude sexuality, as it does so again here, given that 40% of physicians in the US reported in 2010 as to having no training in LGBT health in medical school or in their residencies (Fallin-Bennett 2015, 550) . In addition, remnant homophobia in medical workplaces and schools, especially evident through homophobic remarks, has resulted in a reluctance for medical providers to come out. Fallin-Bennett cites a 2011 study by Mansh and White on the experiences of LGBT medical students, which was presented at the American Association of Medical Colleges annual conference; in the study, 16-17% of lesbians and gay men, 50% of bisexuals, and 60% of those who were transgendered did not disclose their sexual or gender identities in contexts related to medical school in the US (Mansh and White 2011; in Fallin-Bennett 2015, 550) . In addition, Fallin-Bennett surmises, while acknowledging that this requires further study, that LGBT students may be more likely than their heterosexual or genderconforming peers not to apply to medical school or to drop out once they are there (2015, 550) .",

          "text": "With implicit and explicit bias toward them in medical and clinical settings, LGBT patients feel reluctant to come out to their medical providers for fear of discrimination and judgment given that these biases seem to be ignored, if not reinforced, in medical education and clinical training, which can negatively affect the quality of care received by LGBT patients. Historically, this may be because biomedicine has produced highly advanced knowledge of the biological impacts of lived environments with relatively undertheorized analyses of the environments themselves and their social and cultural impacts on medical decisions and patient care (Metzl and Hansen 2014, 129 ). Yet it is also historical to point out, as I have been arguing in this article, that healthcare systems and individual practitioners and researchers have systematically pathologized homosexuality and gender nonconformity, the latter most recently in children. As a result, LGBTQI patients have often undergone reparative conversion therapies, which have now been deemed inappropriate and harmful, and children born with DSD, or disorders in sex development, have been subjected to invasive and damaging interventions, including hormonal treatments and genital cosmetic surgery. More generally, and even without specific Bcorrective^treatments, the lingering, and still all-too-present actual, internalized, and anticipated medical and social stigmas experienced by LGBTQI people often result in risky behaviors amongst those in this vulnerable group that create significant disparities in their physical and mental health (Eckstrand and Sciolla 2014, 12, 14) . It is important to note that the annual report of the United Nations Human Rights Council, published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and entitled BDiscrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity,^stipulates quite clearly that conversion therapy and gender reassignment, when forced or involuntary, as well as unnecessary medical interventions involving intersex children, break the UN's prohibition on torture (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 2015, 11). Moreover, as I have been arguing, the Report also stipulates that discriminatory policies and practices of healthcare institutions adversely affect the quality of health services and deter patients from seeking them (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 2015, 14). This implies radical analyses of new kinds of interventions, contestations, and struggles around the conflation of good health with conformity to gender and sexual norms, as well as further analysis into the contradictions between the urgency of ethical biomedical practice and critical healing alongside the various discourses, ideologies, and cultures which shape biomedicine, and by which biomedical knowledge and clinical practices are themselves shaped.",

My analysis here attempts to expose the ways in which gender and sexual health, in biomedical research and practice, is shaped by and shapes prevailing social norms enabled by the historical shifts I have mentioned earlier. Using queer theory as an analytic lens, I would like to explore the implications, contradictions, and collusions at work in discourses surrounding the diagnostic histories and clinical practices around homosexuality that followed the post-war years, the later diagnostic category BGender Identity Disorder in Childhood^or GIDC, which replaced homosexuality following its removal from the DSM-III in 1980, the more recent diagnostic category BGender Dysphoria in Children^in the current DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association 2013), the identification of risk groups for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV/AIDS, and the broader politics of gender and sexuality that surround biomedical knowledge.",

          "text": "Nowhere in the clinical literature is the politics of diagnosis more evident than in the history of the listing of homosexuality in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in the period following the publication of the Kinsey report in 1948 through the historic 1973 decision to delete homosexuality as a diagnostic category. The first edition of the DSM, published in 1952, listed homosexuality as psychopathological and as a sociopathic personality disturbance during a time of intense social conformity in the Cold War era. Since the Kinsey report shattered the myth of the effeminate male homosexual and indicated that men with homosexual histories could be found in every age group, social level, occupation, and geographical area (1948, 627) , this raised the possibility that gay men could escape detection, and, as Robert Corber argues, linked them with Communists who could conspire to overthrow the US government and subvert its national institutions from within. A resistance to the domestication of gender roles, according to Corber, also raised suspicion toward those men who refused to settle down, raise a family, and take on the roles of breadwinners and homeowners (1997, (11) (12) . With the rise of social activism in the 1960s against the conflation of homosexuality with mental illness, the DSM-II, published in 1968, considered homosexuality as indicative of psychopathology but removed it from the category of sociopathic disturbance, listing it instead under such other Bsexual deviations,^as fetishism, pedophilia, transvestism, and exhibitionism. 2 Clinical work from this period, especially the ten-year study of the etiology of male homosexuality by Irving Bieber, deliberately shifted psychoanalytic attention away from the role of constitutional factors in the development of homosexuality, which Freud quite adamantly indicated as important to consider, 3 to oedipal and pre-oedipal experiences. The clinical research of this era also promulgated the all-too-familiar stereotype that a high proportion of gay men had Bclose-binding^mothers who sexually stimulated their sons through over-close intimacy and seductiveness, showed undue concern for their sons' health and safety, and interfered with the relationship of their sons to their fathers and peers, both of whom enable the process of masculine identification through maternal separation (Bieber et al. 1988, 79-81) . At the same time, Bieber's study found patterns of prehomosexual childhood as a distinguishing factor of the one hundred six homosexual men studied, compared with the childhoods of one hundred heterosexual men in the control group. Seventy-five percent of men in the homosexual group reported excessive fear of injury in their childhoods, girls as primary playmates in a third of the group, and participation in the Busual^games of boys in less than one-fifth (204). As adults, the homosexual men studied exhibited such behaviors as exaggerated shrugging, Bwristbreaking,^lisping, hand-to-hip posturing, and effusiveness, and Bieber reports that these patterns of feminine behavior in males is less an emulation of femininity than a caricature of it, since such behavior in females would appear Bbizarre^rather than feminine (188-89). This predates (but ironically addresses) Judith Butler's much later theory of gender as performative and constituted by Bthe political and cultural intersections in which it is invariably produced and maintained^ (1999, 6) through the citation and embodiment of gender norms.",

Some questions (in engineering for example) involve calculations, while others (in arts, medicine, social sciences, etc.) need in-depth analysis of either a system or a scenarioall calling for theory-based answers. Hence, we need a system of answering theory questions online, to complete the current online testing system in our universities. Secondly, with the current method of keeping answer scripts in the office, there will always be need for more office space to be occupied by these scripts as exams are administered to students. These rooms are potential offices for lecturers. Moreover, paper is prone to destruction by way of fire outbreak or aging, if not well kept. The high cost of printing paper is another challenge to the system. This work is therefore aimed at implementing a paperless theory examination system. This will be achieved through identifying a system of writing with the computer that replaces the use of paper, developing a software package that takes the write up from a student and submits to a central repository and designing a hardware architecture that helps accomplish steps above.",
