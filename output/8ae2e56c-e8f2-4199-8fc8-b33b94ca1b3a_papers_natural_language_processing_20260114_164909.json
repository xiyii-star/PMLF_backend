      "method": "The authors propose using deep learning approaches to classify questions in Albanian, leveraging advanced neural network models to handle the complexity of the language.\n\n**Explanation:** Deep learning approaches, such as neural networks, are capable of learning complex patterns and representations in data. By applying these methods to Albanian question classification, the system can effectively analyze linguistic structures and semantic nuances specific to Albanian, addressing the challenge posed by its complexity and lack of prior research. This enables accurate determination of question types, which is crucial for intelligent conversation systems.",
      "limitation": "- The method focuses solely on the Albanian language, which limits its generalizability to other languages, especially those with different linguistic structures.\n- There is limited prior research on question classification for Albanian, which may restrict the availability of resources and benchmarks to evaluate the proposed approach comprehensively.",
      "future_work": "- Expand research to other complex Indo-European languages: Since the paper focuses on Albanian, future work could involve applying similar deep learning approaches to other under-researched languages within the same linguistic family.\n- Enhance dataset size and diversity: Future work could focus on creating larger and more diverse datasets for Albanian question classification to improve model robustness and generalization.\n- Explore advanced deep learning architectures: Investigating more sophisticated or specialized neural network models could further improve classification accuracy for Albanian questions.\n- Integrate question classification into broader conversational AI systems: Future directions might include embedding the classification models into comprehensive Albanian-language Question Answering systems."

By engaging learners in collaborative activities that transcend traditional boundaries, it enables the generation of new practices and tools that are better suited to dynamic and complex environments. This directly addresses the limitations of traditional learning approaches by fostering adaptability and innovation.",

This systematic review addresses the lack of clarity by offering structured data and analysis on the subject.",
