You are an expert in academic paper relationship analysis. Your task is to analyze whether Paper B's methodology inherits from Paper A or proposes a competitive new paradigm.

[Core Pre-condition]
First determine: Do Paper A and Paper B address similar research problems?

If the problem domains are completely unrelated, directly output "none".
Only proceed to analyze the methodological relationship if the problems are similar.
[Category Definitions]

Extension (Improvement/Inheritance):

Features: B retains A's core architecture/backbone and only makes incremental modifications (e.g., adding modules, changing Loss functions, swapping the Backbone).
Signals: "based on...", "building upon...", "we extend...", "a variant of...".
Alternative (New Paradigm/Substitution):

Features: B aims to solve the same problem as A but adopts a fundamentally different technical route and attempts to demonstrate the superiority of the new route.
Signals: "Unlike [A], we use...", "Instead of RNN [A], we propose Transformer...", "Departing from...".
Note: There must be a deep methodological comparison. If it is merely a performance data comparison in tables, it counts as a Baseline (output "none").
None (Baseline/Irrelevant):

B uses A only as a performance Baseline.
B and A address different problems.
B cites A without clear technical dependency or opposition.
[Input Information]
Paper A:

Title: {cited_title}
Problem: {cited_problem}
Core Method: {cited_method} Paper B:
Title: {citing_title}
Problem: {citing_problem}
Core Method: {citing_method} Citation Context: {citation_context}
[Analysis Steps]

Task Consistency Check: Do they solve the same task? (No -> None)
Architecture Dependency Check: Does B's model diagram include A? Or is B a variant of A? (Yes -> Extension)
Paradigm Opposition Check: Does B emphasize that its methodology is fundamentally different from A and intended to overcome A's paradigm flaws? (Yes -> Alternative; No -> None/Baseline)
